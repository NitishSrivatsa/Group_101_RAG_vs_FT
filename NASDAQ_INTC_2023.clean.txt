A Year in Review

2023 revenue was$54.2 billion, down$8.8 billion, or 14%, from 2022. CCG revenue decreased 8%due to lower notebook and desktop
volume from lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer
inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core
products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased
mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 20%due to lower server volume
resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related
revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31%as customers tempered purchases to reduce
inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines. We invested$16.0 billion in R&D, made capital investments
of$25.8 billion, and had$11.5 billion in cash from operations and$(11.9) billion of adjusted free cash flow.

Managing to our long-term financial model

Our 2023 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. We continued to prioritize investments critical to our IDM 2.0 transformation, achieved
operational milestones, and executed disciplined expense management. To achieve our long-term financial model, we believe it is imperative that we drive to world-class product
cost and operational efficiency. A key component of our overall strategy is our internal foundry model. Under this model, we intend to reshape our operational dynamics and
establish transparency and accountability through standalone profit and loss reporting for our manufacturing group in 2024. We expect this model to enable increased efficiencies
across a number of aspects of our organization that we believe are integral to achieving our financial and operational goals. At the same time, we continue to prioritize capital
investments critical to our efforts to regain process leadership and establish a leading-edge, at-scale foundry business.

Investing in leading-edge, at-scale manufacturing

We are committed to strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leading-edge semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced
manufacturing capacity. In the US, we are expanding our existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio.
We have submitted all four of our major project proposals in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, estimated to represent over$100 billion of US manufacturing and research
investments over the next five years, to the US Department of Commerce's CHIPS Program Office.

In the European Union and Israel, we have announced a series of investments, spanning our existing operations in Ireland and Israel, as well as our planned investment of more
than$33 billion in Germany to build a leading-edge wafer fabrication mega-site, and our plans to invest up to$4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland. We also
announced the start of high-volume manufacturing using Intel 4 technology and EUV technology in Ireland.

Unlocking value

We continue to look for innovative ways to unlock value for our stakeholders. We sold a 32.4%minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication business, including investments from
Bain Capital and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Net proceeds resulting from the IMS minority stake sales totaled$1.4 billion. We also executed a
secondary offering of Mobileye stock that generated net proceeds of$1.6 billion. Further, we communicated our intent to operate our Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a
standalone business, with standalone financial reporting beginning January 1, 2024. This is expected to enable potential private and public equity investments. These
transactions provide an additional source of capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our strategy.

Fundamentals of Our Business

Our Strategy

Technology permeates every aspect of our lives and is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see
continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this digital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create
a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers:
ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together these superpowers combine to amplify and reinforce each other, and will
exponentially increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing
these superpowers for our customers' growth and our own.

We are uniquely positioned with the depth and breadth of our silicon, platforms, and software, and packaging and process technology with at-scale manufacturing. With these
strengths and the tailwinds of the superpowers driving digital disruption, our strategy to win is focused on four key themes: product leadership, open platforms, manufacturing at
scale, and our people.

Our Priorities

Product Leadership

Lead and democratize compute with Intel x86 and xPU. Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from data center to network, PCs, edge computing, and the
emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving, to serve an increasingly smart and connected world.

At our core is the x86 computing ecosystem, which supports an extensive and deep universe of software applications, with billions of lines of code written and optimized for x86
CPUs. We continue to advance this ecosystem with x86 microarchitectures focused on performance, which push the limits of low latency and single-threaded application
performance, and microarchitectures focused on efficiency, which are designed for computing throughput efficiency to enable scalable multithreaded performance.

Beyond the CPU, we are delivering a growing family of xPU products, which encompass client and data center GPUs, IPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The xPU approach
recognizes that different workloads benefit from different computing architectures, and our broad portfolio helps meet our customers' increasingly diverse computing needs. As
part of our strategy, we seek to develop and offer leading products across each of these architectural categories.

We also seek to address every phase of the AI continuum, including the largest, most challenging GenAI and large language models. We believe AI represents a generational
shift in computing by expanding human abilities and solving the most challenging problems. We are in the early stages of realizing AI's full potential and GenAI is just the
beginning. Our strategy is to bring AI to where the data is being generated and used and we believe we have a full spectrum of hardware and software platforms, offering open
and modular solutions, for competitive total cost of ownership and time to value that customers need to win in this era of exponential growth and AI everywhere. We are infusing
AI into Intel technologies, supporting today's GenAI workloads, fueling emerging usages like AI PC and AI at the edge, and pioneering innovations that we believe advance the
future of AI in the next decade. We believe our leadership in IP, process, packaging, security, software, services, manufacturing, and foundry services positions us to realize AI's
full potential to transform industries and solve the world's biggest challenges.

Fundamentals of Our Business

Open Platforms

We aim to deliver open software and hardware platforms with industry-defining standards. Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on
open standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, ThunderboltTM, and PCI
Express*. We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers constantly
innovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the development of
flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-engineering, and
open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation. Through our oneAPI initiative, developers use a unified language across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs that is designed
to reduce development time and to enhance productivity. We also deliver a steady stream of open-source code and optimizations that are designed for projects across virtually
every platform and usage model. We are committed to co-engineering and jointly designing, building, and validating new products with software industry leaders to accelerate
mutual technology advancements and help new software and hardware work better together. Our commitment extends to developers through our developer-first approach based
on openness, choice, and trust.

Ultimately, we believe our pivot to a software-defined, silicon-enhanced strategy will enable us to realize value at all layers of the compute stack. This should allow us to continue
to monetize foundational and ecosystem-enabling software through hardware sales, limited licensing, and customer-enabling service offerings. Additionally, we are expanding our
software portfolio by developing and monetizing software solutions, services, and platforms with SaaS, software subscriptions, and other business models. We are prioritizing
three portfolios of offerings for our SaaS and subscription-based software: AI, trust and security, and performance optimization. We are also scaling the availability of Intel
Developer Cloud, which is designed to enable developers to learn, prototype, test, and run their own AI workloads across multiple Intel hardware architectures to experience the
competitive performance of Intel platforms and develop their AI software from today’s hardware portfolio to next-generation architectures.

®

An open approach and deep engagement with the developer ecosystem are essential to lowering barriers to entry and unlocking AI innovations for developers and customers.
We are expediting an open AI software ecosystem that we believe is needed to break down proprietary walls. We offer customers, partners, and developers early access and a
rapid path to scale their AI solutions with the Intel Developer Cloud and integrated and scalable hardware and software systems and solutions.

We believe AI will only be truly accessible to all when its use is ethical and responsible. Partnering with industry leaders, we are working to deliver innovative ecosystem tools
and solutions intended to make AI safer and more secure, and help address privacy concerns as AI scales exponentially. We are building platforms and technologies for the
convergence of AI and security to help customers confidently secure diverse AI workloads across the data center, cloud, PC, and edge.

Manufacturing at Scale

IDM 2.0, the next evolution and expansion of our IDM model, is a differentiated strategy that combines three capabilities:

Internal factory network. Our global, internal factory network has been foundational to our success, enabling product optimization, improved economics, and supply resilience.
We intend to remain a leading developer of process technology and a major manufacturer of semiconductors and will continue to build the majority of our products in our
factories.

Strategic use of foundry capacity. We expect to expand our use of third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, which will provide us with increased flexibility and scale to optimize
our product roadmaps for cost, performance, schedule, and supply. Our use of foundry capacity will include manufacturing for a range of modular tiles on advanced process
technologies.

Open System Foundry. We are building a world-class foundry business to meet the growing long-term global demand for semiconductors. We plan to differentiate our foundry
offerings from those of others through a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe available for customers
globally, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP. The current foundry model enabled explosion of ecosystem innovation at the
wafer level. We believe this established model has historically served the industry well, but a new mindset is needed in our new era of chipmaking. As innovation evolves, we see
the rack has collapsed into a system and the system has collapsed into an advanced package. We are building out an Open System Foundry that has four components: wafer
fabrication, packaging, chiplet standard, and software.

The Open System Foundry involves engaging with customers at multiple levels, from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system
architectures. We intend to build our customers' silicon designs and deliver full end-to-end customizable products built with our advanced packaging technology.

We believe our IDM 2.0 strategy enables us to deliver leading process technology and products to meet growing long-term demand using internal and external capacity, while
leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others and providing superior capacity, supply resilience, and an advantageous cost structure.

In the upcoming year, we plan to implement an internal foundry model, where our business units engage with our manufacturing group in an arm's-length fashion, similar to how
fabless semiconductor companies engage with external foundries. The model is integral to our IDM 2.0 operational and financial strategies and aims to fully leverage our
invested capital while serving a wide variety of chip customers worldwide.

Fundamentals of Our Business

Recent events, including the pandemic-related global chip shortage, made clear how supply chain disruptions can severely impact everyday life. The steady rise of chipmaking
capacity in Asia has made the world vulnerable to continued and increasingly extreme shortages. We believe a secure, balanced, and resilient supply of semiconductors is
essential to the interests of the entire global economy. With one of the most geographically balanced supply chains across North America, Europe and Asia, we plan to partner
with the public sector to strengthen the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain by investing in a more geographically balanced capacity. We believe our investments
will help develop a more resilient supply chain for generations to come and hedge against geopolitical instability.

Our People

Our world-class talent is at the heart of everything we do. Together we strive to have a positive effect on business, society, and the planet. Delivering on our strategy and growth
ambitions requires attracting, developing, and retaining top talent from across the world. Our people build our technology, unlock new business opportunities, and work with our
partners and customers to create global impact.

Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world’s best
engineers and technologists can fulfill their dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.

Growth Imperative

We are investing to position the company for accelerated long-term growth, focusing on both our core businesses and our growth businesses. In our client and server
businesses, our strategy is to invest to strengthen the competitiveness of our product roadmap and to explore new opportunities. We believe we have significant opportunities to
grow and gain share in graphics; mobility, including autonomous driving; networking and edge; AI; software; and foundry services.

Focus on Innovation and Execution

We are focused on executing our product and process roadmap and accelerating our cadence of innovation. We have set a detailed process and packaging technology roadmap
and announced key architectural innovations to further our goal of delivering leadership products in every area in which we compete. We are returning our culture to its roots in
innovation and execution, drawing on principles established by our former CEO Andy Grove that emphasize discipline and accountability. This includes using OKRs throughout
the organization to drive a common purpose.

To help us execute toward our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are leveraging our Smart Capital approach. This approach is designed to enable us to adjust quickly to opportunities in the
market, while managing our margin structure and capital spending. The key elements of Smart Capital include:

▪

▪

▪

▪

▪

Smart capacity investments. We are aggressively building out manufacturing shell space, which gives us flexibility in how and when we bring additional capacity online
based on milestone triggers such as product readiness, market conditions, and customer commitments.
Government incentives. We are continuing to work with governments in the US and Europe to advance and benefit from incentives for domestic manufacturing capacity
for leading-edge semiconductors.
SCIP. We are accessing strategically aligned capital to increase our flexibility and help efficiently accelerate and scale manufacturing build-outs. This type of coinvestment also demonstrates how private capital is unlocked and becomes a force multiplier for government incentives for semiconductor manufacturing expansion.

Customer commitments. IFS is working closely with potential customers to make advance payments to secure capacity. This provides us with the advantage of

Financial Capital

We take a disciplined approach to our financial capital allocation strategy, which continues to focus on building stakeholder value and is driven by our priority to invest in the
business and capacity and our capital needs. We also seek to pay competitive dividends, optimize our portfolio, look for innovative ways to unlock value across our assets, and,
from time-to-time, engage in mergers and acquisitions. As we invest in our IDM 2.0 strategy and implement our next phase of capacity expansions and the acceleration of our
process technology roadmap, our allocation priorities have shifted more heavily toward investing in the business and away from stock repurchases. In the long term, we will
continue to look for opportunities to further our strategy through acquisitions while remaining disciplined on capital allocation.

Our Financial Capital Allocation Strategy

Invest in the Business

Our first allocation priority is to invest in R&D and capital spending to capitalize on the opportunity presented by the world's demand for semiconductors. In 2023, we continued
our focus on capital investment and the deployment of our Smart Capital strategy.

Return Excess Cash to Stockholders

Our capital allocation strategy includes returning excess cash to stockholders. We achieve this through our dividend policy and, when permissible, stock repurchases. In 2023,
we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support the critical
investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. We expect future stock repurchases to continue to be curtailed
during this time of meaningful investment in capital.

Optimize our Portfolio and Unlock Value

Our capital allocation strategy also includes opportunistic investment in and acquisition of companies that complement our strategic objectives. We look for acquisitions that
supplement and strengthen our capital and R&D investments.

We also seek to drive value creation through transactions such as the 2022 Mobileye IPO, the 2023 minority stake sales in IMS, and the 2023 announcement of our intent to
operate PSG as a standalone business which we expect to enable potential private and public equity investments. Together, these transactions provide an additional source of
capital to support the critical investments needed to advance our business strategy.

Lastly, we take action when investments do not strategically align to our key priorities. In the last three years, we exited numerous businesses, including the NAND memory
business and Intel OptaneTM memory business.

Research and Development

R&D investment is critical to enable us to deliver on our accelerated technology roadmap, introduce leading products, and develop new businesses and capabilities in the future.
We seek to protect our R&D efforts through our IP rights and may augment R&D initiatives by acquiring or investing in companies, entering into R&D agreements, and directly
purchasing or licensing technology.

Areas Key to Product Leadership

We have intensified our focus on areas key to product leadership. Our objective with each new generation of products is to improve user experiences and value through
advances in performance, power, cost, connectivity, security, form factor, and other features. We also focus on reducing our design complexity, re-using IP, and increasing
ecosystem collaboration to improve our efficiency.

Process and packaging. Our leading-edge process and packaging technology and world-class IP portfolio are key to the success of our strategy. We are committed to achieving
process technology leadership in 2025 by planning to deliver five technology nodes in four years. In addition, we have solidified our process and packaging offerings to external
customers through IFS.

Intel 7 process node is in production for our 13th Gen Intel Core processors and represents the continuous improvement of transistor and interconnect performance.

Intel 4, our first EUV node, delivers significant density scaling and approximately 20%performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 7. The Intel Core Ultra processor is
our first high-volume client product on Intel 4 and began shipping to customers in Q3 2023.
Intel 3 is expected to deliver further logic scaling and up to 18%performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 4. Intel 3 is our first advanced node offered to IFS
customers and is optimized for the needs of data center products.
Intel 20A will follow Intel 3 and will introduce two breakthrough technologies that we expect to deliver up to a 15%performance-per-watt improvement over Intel 3:
RibbonFET and PowerVia. RibbonFET, our implementation of a gate-all-around transistor, is designed to deliver faster transistor switching speeds while achieving the
same drive current as multiple fins, but in a smaller footprint. PowerVia is our unique industry-first implementation of backside power delivery that is designed to
optimize signal transmission by eliminating the need for power routing on the front side of the wafer.

Intel 18A, our second IFS advanced node offering, will improve on Intel 20A by delivering ribbon innovation for design optimization and line width reduction. Intel 18A is
expected to deliver an additional 10%improvement in performance per watt over Intel 20A.

Beyond Intel 18A, we have initiated definition and development of our next two process nodes and continue to define, build, and develop the next-generation High
Numerical Aperture EUV lithography into our process technology roadmap. To continue our modernization and infrastructure expansions, we have begun the installation
of the world’s first High-NA EUV tool for commercial use at our Gordon Moore Park in Oregon.

Our family of 3D advanced packaging technology will usher in the next generation of Foveros technology, enabling us to mix multiple top die tiles with multiple base tiles
across mixed fab nodes, providing greater flexibility for disaggregated chip designs. Our future Foveros Direct technology should scale interconnect pitch below 10μm,
enable direct copper-to-copper bonding for low-resistance interconnects, and blur the boundary between wafer and package. Longer term, we expect to deliver
complete glass substrate solutions as the next generation of advanced packaging designed to enable continued scaling of transistors in a package.

xPU architecture. We believe the future is a diverse mix of scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial architectures deployed in CPU, GPU, IPU, accelerator, and FPGA sockets,
enabled by a scalable software stack and integrated into systems by advanced packaging technology. We are building processors that span several major computing
architectures, moving toward an era of heterogeneous computing:

▪

▪

CPU. We started shipping our 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors based on Intel 7 with built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security
capabilities. We also launched our 14th Gen Intel Core processors, which are designed to scale from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook
platforms. These are based on a hybrid architecture utilizing our most advanced performance cores and power-efficient cores.

GPU and HPC. The Intel Arc graphics family offers modern GPU features to power today's demanding games, applications, and AI workloads. In 2023, the Intel Arc
portfolio expanded while offering a substantial performance uplift through continual driver updates, offering consumer and professional solutions that target a significant
part of the market. Intel Arc discrete GPUs currently ship in three performance tiers, with Intel Arc 7, 5, and 3 series for consumers, and Intel Arc Pro A60, A50, and A40
for workstations. In the mobile segment, Intel Arc A-series GPUs can be found powering a range of consumer and workstation designs. In Q1 2023, we launched the
Intel Xeon CPU Max Series and Intel Data Center GPU Max Series. Designed for the future compute demands of HPC and AI workloads, the Intel Max Series
product family power the Aurora supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory.

Infrastructure Acceleration. Our first ASIC IPU has been deployed widely across Google Cloud. Our second generation IPU, is also co-developed with Google and is
expected to tape in the first half of 2024. It is expected to double the throughput and compute capabilities. The IPU becomes the center of the CSP compute platform,
with the bulk of CSP infrastructure cycles spent running on the IPU and not the host processor. This frees up processing cores for business-value applications and
infrastructure as a service rental.

Ethernet. Our 200G foundational network interface card targeting cloud, enterprise, and edge, is expected to go into production in 2H 2024 and extend our 100G
market. Additionally, we plan to productize our 10G/2.5G/1G offering, a refresh of our high-volume 10G and 1G portfolio with modernized software, management, and
manufacturing technologies.

Matrix Accelerator. We are showing strong customer and performance momentum for our Intel Gaudi AI accelerators. In Q3 2023, we announced that a large AI
supercomputer would be built entirely on Intel Xeon processors and 4,000 Intel Gaudi 2 AI hardware accelerators, with Stability AI as the anchor customer.

Software. Software unleashes the potential of our hardware platforms across all workloads, domains, and architectures.

▪

oneAPI adoption continues to expand across the industry. oneAPI is designed to enable developers to build cross-architecture applications using a single code base
across CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs to reduce development time and enhance productivity. Our oneAPI-based tools take advantage of unique hardware features and lower
software development and maintenance costs. Developers can choose the best architecture for the problem at hand without rewriting their entire code base,
accelerating their time to value.

▪ We seek to accelerate adoption of oneAPI and Intel software developer tools through diverse ecosystem activities, including developer training, summits, centers of

excellence, access to Intel hardware and software through Intel Developer Cloud and industry collaboration through the Linux Foundation's Unified Acceleration (UXL)
Foundation project. Our Intel Developer Cloud offering is designed to host global users spanning AI, data science, high-performance computing, media and graphics,
and other accelerated computing workloads using oneAPI and the latest Intel hardware.

▪ We believe AI will be ubiquitous, and with our tools and the broad open software ecosystem, we are well-positioned to scale AI. We optimize and contribute software to

popular frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, to achieve the best performance for Intel platforms and to deliver productivity and programmability for AI
developers. We are accelerating the disruption of the proprietary ecosystems through Intel contributions to new software AI languages such as Triton, Mojo, and JAX.
This higher level of open, vendor-independent programmability, combined with Intel's commitment to open spec governance, implementations, licensing models, and
segment-optimized solutions, such as OpenVINOTM powered by oneAPI, offers customers a choice of hardware and software stack tailored to diverse workload needs.

▪ We seek to continually improve our system and foundational-level software in support of our client, data center, networking, and graphics products, delivering AI-

optimized software across the stack, including BIOS, firmware, simulation, operating systems, and virtualization.

IP Rights

We own and develop significant IP and related IP rights around the world that support our products, services, R&D, and other activities and assets. Our IP portfolio includes
patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works, and other rights. We actively seek to protect our global IP rights and deter unauthorized use of our IP and other
assets.

We have obtained patents in the US and other countries. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents
related to them expire, and in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents are granted. As we expand our product offerings, particularly around our foundry
business, we also seek to extend our patent development efforts. In addition to developing patents based on our own R&D efforts, we may purchase or license patents from third
parties.

The software that we distribute, including software embedded in our products, is entitled to copyright and other IP protection. To distinguish our products from our competitors'
products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products, and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to
identify products containing genuine Intel components. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the
information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.

Efforts to protect our IP can be difficult, particularly in countries that provide less protection to IP rights and in the absence of harmonized international IP standards. Competitors
and others may already have IP rights covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain IP rights covering our own products or that we will be able to
obtain IP licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of IP-related risks, see "Risk Factors" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information. While
our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, copyright, or other IP right.

Our Capital

Manufacturing Capital

As the guardians of Moore's Law, we continue to innovate to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address our customers' greatest challenges. This
makes possible new leadership products with higher performance while balancing power efficiency, cost, and size.

Our IDM 2.0 strategy allows us to deliver leadership products using internal and external capacity while leveraging our core strengths to provide foundry services to others. IDM
2.0 combines three capabilities. First, we will continue to build most of our products in our fabs. Second, we expect to expand our use of third-party foundry capacity to
manufacture a range of modular tiles on advanced process technologies. Third, we are building a world-class foundry business with IFS, which we expect will combine leadingedge packaging and process technology, committed capacity in the US and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio that will include x86 cores, as well as other ecosystem IP.

Network and Supply Chain

In 2023, our factories delivered continuous support to our customers as we ramped new process technologies and equipment for our products and expanded Open System
Foundry offerings. We continue to work across our supply chain to minimize disruptions, improve productivity, and increase overall capacity and output to meet customer
expectations.

Our global supply chain supports internal partners across architecture, product design, technology development, manufacturing and operations, sales and marketing, and
business units, and our supply ecosystem comprises thousands of suppliers globally. Our mission is to enable product and process leadership, industry-leading total cost of
ownership, and on-time and uninterrupted supply for our customers, delivered in a responsible and sustainable manner.

As of the end of 2023, we had nine geographically dispersed manufacturing sites in production. The following map shows the locations of these factory sites. Our manufacturing
facilities are primarily used for silicon wafer manufacturing, assembling, testing, and advanced packaging. We operate in a network of manufacturing facilities integrated as
though they were one factory to provide the most flexible supply capacity, allowing us to better analyze our production costs and adapt to changes in capacity needs. Our new
process technologies, when ready for high volume manufacturing, are transferred from a central development fab to one or more of our manufacturing facilities. The network of
factories and the development fab collaborate to continue driving operational improvements. This enables fast ramp of the operation, quick learning, and quality control.

We are expanding manufacturing capacity across multiple sites and geographies. These include silicon wafer manufacturing in Arizona, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Ohio, and
Oregon and advanced packaging manufacturing in Malaysia and New Mexico. This year, we added Poland to our assembly and test expansion roadmap. These investments
further our IDM 2.0 strategy and are expected to support a resilient semiconductor supply chain and to create the foundation for a next-generation chip ecosystem.

Our Capital

Human Capital

Our human capital strategy is grounded in our belief that our people are fundamental to our success. Delivering on our strategy and growth ambitions requires attracting,
developing, and retaining top talent across the world. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace where the world's best engineers and technologists can fulfill their
dreams and create technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. We invest in our highly skilled workforce of 124,800 people (as of December 30, 2023) by
creating practices, programs, and benefits that support the evolving world of work and our employees' needs.

Our human capital philosophy includes three pillars we believe are needed to position our talent strategy as a competitive advantage:

▪

▪

▪

Hire and retain the best talent: We have embraced the future of work with a flexible, hybrid-first approach that differentiates Intel from competitors.

Develop our talent to full potential: We have updated role descriptions and career pathways to better enable movement and help top talent work on the highest priorities.

Create a winning culture: We have reignited Intel's results-driven, performance culture.

Fostering a culture of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability is also core to our strategy. We believe that an inclusive culture is important for attracting, developing, and
retaining top talent, and we strive to provide a work environment where all employees from all backgrounds are valued, challenged, and rewarded. We are focused on
reinvigorating our culture to strengthen our execution and accelerate our cadence of innovation. Our values—customer first, fearless innovation, results driven, one Intel,
inclusion, quality, and integrity—inspire us and are key to delivering on our purpose. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Intel Code of Conduct, and
Intel's Global Human Rights Principles, which form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.

Talent Management
We continue to see significant competition for talent throughout the semiconductor industry. Our hiring was limited in 2023, in line with macroeconomic forecasts, financial
performance, and cost-cutting measures, and we took actions to rebalance our workforce. However, the investments we are making to accelerate our process technology require
continued and focused efforts to attract and retain talent—especially technical talent. Our undesired turnover rate was 5.6%in both 2023 and 2022.


We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Intel an employer of choice. We offer extensive training programs
and provide rotational assignment opportunities and have updated our job architecture to help employees create custom learning curricula for building skills and owning their
careers. To further support the growth and development of our people, we continue to increase mentoring in our technical community, drive engagement through employee
resource groups, and promote health and wellness resources to all our people. Through our annual employee experience survey, employee inclusion survey, and manager
development feedback survey, employees can voice their perceptions of the company, their managers, their work experiences, and their learning and development opportunities.
Our employees' voices are important to enable our culture of continuous improvement, and as a result, we link a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to
year-over-year improvements of our employee experience survey results. Our performance management system is designed to support our cultural evolution and to increase our
focus on disciplined OKRs.


Undesired turnover includes all regular Intel employees who voluntarily left Intel, but does not include Intel contract employees, interns, or employees who separated from Intel due to divestiture,
retirement, voluntary separation packages, death, job elimination, or redeployment.

Fundamentals of Our Business

Our Capital

Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion are core elements of Intel's values and instrumental to driving innovation
and positioning us for growth. Over the past decade, we have taken actions to integrate diversity
and inclusion expectations into our culture, performance and management systems, leadership
expectations, and annual bonus metrics. Through our annual employee inclusion survey,
employees can voice their experiences at Intel and provide feedback on how we can continue to
improve. We are proud of what we have accomplished to advance diversity and inclusion, but we
believe we can achieve more, including beyond the walls of Intel. Our RISE strategy and 2030
goals set our global ambitions for the rest of the decade, including, in part, ambitious goals to
achieve 25%representation of women in senior leadership; achieve 12%representation of
underrepresented minorities in US senior leadership; achieve 10%representation of employees
with a disability in our global workforce; and exceed 40%representation of women in technical
roles, including engineering positions and other roles with technical job requirements. Our
ambitious goals were established, in part, based on modeling of where market availability is
expected to be in 2030. Market availability analysis will be re-conducted over the time period to
assess ongoing alignment and expectations. To drive accountability, we continue to link a portion
of our executive and employee compensation to diversity and inclusion metrics.

We have committed our scale, expertise, and reach through our comprehensive RISE strategy to
work with customers and other stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of inclusive business
practices across industries. As part of the Alliance for Global Inclusion, we worked with a coalition
of technology companies to create a global inclusion index survey, which serves as a benchmark
for companies to track diversity and inclusion improvements, provide information on current best
practices, and highlight opportunities to improve outcomes across industries. The results of the
third global inclusion index survey were published in 2023 and shared with business leaders
across industries. For the first time, based on the maturity of the respondents' best practices, the
survey results transitioned to an index, in which organizations that received an overall score of
50%or higher across all regions in which they participated were recognized for their diversity and
inclusion efforts. There were 27 respondents and, of those, 18 earned spots on the index,
including Intel. This collective effort allows the industry to more clearly identify actions needed to
advance progress on closing persistent gaps and advancing more inclusive practices in
workplaces, industry, and society. The survey shows increased commitment to diversity and
inclusion around key areas of workforce inclusivity, recruitment, advancement opportunities, and
accountability. We will also continue to collaborate on initiatives that expand the diverse pipeline of
talent for our industry, advance social equity, make technology fully inclusive, and expand digital
readiness for millions of people around the world.


Senior leadership refers to salary grades 10+ and equivalent grades. While we present male and female, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing

of all gender identities.
 The term underrepresented minority (URM) is used to describe diverse populations, including Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native American
employees in the US.

Compensation and Benefits

We structure pay, benefits, and services to meet the varying needs of our employees, helping support employee financial well-being with competitive compensation, investment
opportunities, and financial resources. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan,
healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, parent reintegration, fertility assistance, flexible work schedules, sabbaticals, and on-site services. Since 2019,
we have achieved gender pay equity globally and we continue to maintain race/ethnicity pay equity in the US. We achieve pay equity by closing the gap in average pay between
employees of different genders or race/ethnicity in the same or similar roles after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as location, time at
grade level, and tenure. We have also advanced transparency in our pay and representation data by publicly releasing our EEO-1 survey pay data since 2019. We believe that
our holistic approach toward pay equity, representation, and creating an inclusive culture enables us to cultivate a workplace that helps employees develop and progress in their
careers at all levels. Our "hybrid-first" approach to working was informed by employees surveyed around the globe and involves the majority of our employees splitting their time
between working remotely and in the office. Hybrid-first and remote work options cast a wider recruitment net and support our ambition to hire the best global talent. Currently,
there is no company-wide mandate on the number of days per week employees should be on site or how they should collaborate. Our goal is to enable remote and on-site work
where it drives the best output, while providing our employees with equitable access to systems, resources, and opportunities that allow them to succeed.

Health, Safety, and Wellness

We are committed to providing a safe and injury-free workplace. We regularly invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access
to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including on-site health centers, and we aim to increase awareness of and support for mental
and behavioral health. In support of our RISE goals, we intend to continue our efforts to build our strong safety culture and drive the global expansion of our corporate wellness
program through employee education and engagement activities.

Fundamentals of Our Business

Our Capital

Social and Relationship Capital

We are committed to engaging in initiatives that support our communities and help us develop trusted relationships with our stakeholders. Proactive engagement with our
stakeholders and investments in social impact initiatives, including those aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, advance our position as a leading
corporate citizen and create shared value for Intel, our global supply chain, and our communities.

Economic and social. The health of our business and local economies depends in part on continued investments in innovation. We provide high-skill, high-paying jobs around the
world, many of which are manufacturing and R&D jobs located in our factories. As we expand operations in both existing and new locations around the world, we are building a
pipeline of qualified workers through our talent strategy and the many investments we are making in education. We also benefit economies through our R&D ecosystem
spending, sourcing activities, employee spending, and tax payments. We make sizable capital investments and provide leadership in public-private partnerships to spur
economic growth and innovation.

We stand at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to empower individuals, companies, and governments around the world to solve global challenges.
We aim to empower people through education and advance social initiatives to create career pathways into the technology industry. This includes our global Intel Digital
Readiness Programs, such as AI for Youth and AI for Workforce, scaled in partnership with governments and institutions to empower individuals with digital readiness and AI
skills. Additionally, we invest in multi-year partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities in the US to increase the number of Black/African Americans who pursue
electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science fields. Our employees and retirees share their expertise through volunteer initiatives in the communities
where we operate, volunteering 3.8 million hours over the past four years. These efforts contribute to our RISE goal to volunteer 10 million hours over a decade. Since 2020, we
announced and further expanded upon the Intel RISE Technology Initiative, which provides an expanded channel to build deeper relationships with our customers and partners
aligned with our corporate purpose and work to create shared value through our RISE strategy. Specifically, we are funding projects in areas such as using technology to improve
health and safety, making technology more inclusive while expanding digital readiness, and carbon-neutral computing to help address climate change.


Human rights commitment. We are committed to maintaining and improving systems and processes to avoid causing or contributing to adverse impacts on human rights in our
own operations, products, and supply chain. We have established an integrated approach to managing human rights across our business, including senior-level management
involvement and board-level oversight. We also meet throughout the year with external stakeholders and experts on human rights to continue to inform and evolve our human
rights policies and oversight processes. While we do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end users may develop, we do
not support or tolerate our products being used to adversely impact human rights. Where we become aware of a concern that Intel products are being used by a business partner
in connection with abuses of human rights, we intend to evaluate and restrict or cease business with the third party unless and until we have a high confidence that Intel's
products are not being used to adversely impact human rights.


This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2024.

Fundamentals of Our Business

Our Capital

Supply Chain Responsibility

We actively manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation
for Intel, our customers, and our suppliers. To drive responsible and sustainable practices throughout our supply chain, we have robust programs to educate and engage
suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations. We actively collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving
transparency around climate and water impacts in the global electronics supply chain and, as part of our RISE strategy, we are advancing collaboration across our industry on
responsible minerals sourcing. Through these efforts we help set electronics industry-wide standards, develop audit processes, and conduct training.

Over the past decade, we have directly engaged with suppliers to verify compliance and build capacity to address risks of forced and bonded labor and other human rights
issues. We perform periodic audits, and identify critical direct suppliers to engage through capability-building programs, which help suppliers build sustainability acumen and
verify compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance and the Intel Code of Conduct. We also engage with indirect suppliers through our programs on forced and bonded
labor, responsible minerals, and supplier diversity. To achieve our RISE goals, we are significantly expanding the number of suppliers covered by our engagement activities. The
supply chain environmental team is also actively engaging suppliers to measure and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions footprints and the resulting impact on our footprint.
These activities are intended to help us meet our long-term emissions reductions goals, including our goal to achieve net-zero upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by
2050, which we announced in 2023.

Our commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our suppliers. We believe a diverse supply chain supports greater innovation and value for our business. We have set
additional spending targets with women-owned suppliers outside the US and with minority-owned suppliers globally to accelerate progress toward our goal to increase global
annual spending with diverse suppliers to reach$2.0 billion in annual spending by 2030.

Natural Capital

Driving to the lowest possible environmental footprint as we grow helps us create efficiencies, support our communities, and respond to the needs of our stakeholders. We invest
in environmental projects and set company-wide environmental targets to drive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water use, and waste generation. We build
energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions, energy usage, and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to
use technology to address environmental challenges.

In April 2022, we announced our new goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2040, creating an important target to strengthen our commitment to
sustainable business practices. We furthered our commitment in 2023 by announcing our goal to reach net-zero upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our
2030 RISE goals continue to be important milestones to drive to higher levels of operational efficiency, including a goal of a 10%reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions on
an absolute basis from a 2019 baseline by 2030. We continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, and to make additional
investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation. In 2023, we linked a portion of the executive and employee performance
bonus to our goal to reduce our 2023 Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 130,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent, compared to 2022. Our RISE strategy also
focuses on addressing climate change impacts upstream and downstream in the value chain. This includes improving product energy efficiency and increasing our "handprint"—
the ways in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains,
and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient.

In August 2023, we published our inaugural green bond report, which provides an update on the allocation of the net proceeds of the$1.3 billion principal amount of senior notes
issued in 2022. We are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations, which can include items such as
green buildings, energy efficiency, circular economy and waste management, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, water stewardship, and renewable energy.

Energy

We focus on reducing our own climate change impact, and over the past two decades have reduced our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy
consumption. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to a goal of conserving 4 billion kWh of energy this decade. We have conserved 1.6 billion kWh of energy
cumulatively since 2020. We also invest in renewable electricity and on-site alternative energy projects in support of our 2030 goal to achieve 100%renewable electricity use
across our global operations. In 2023, continuing our practice of linking a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our corporate sustainability metrics, we
linked a portion of the performance bonus to our 2023 target to reach 95%renewable electricity use globally. We reached our target and achieved 99%renewable electricity
usage globally in 2023.




This is a preliminary estimate. The final number will be reported in our 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be issued later in 2024.

Water Stewardship

Water is essential to the semiconductor manufacturing process. We use ultrapure water to remove impurities from our silicon wafers, and we use fresh and reclaimed water to
run our manufacturing facility systems. Through our RISE goals, we have committed to achieve net positive water globally, and as part of that effort, conserve 60 billion gallons of
water in this decade. Water conservation reduces the amount of water needed from fresh water sources; we have conserved 35.9 billion gallons of water and enabled
restoration of 9.6 billion gallons of water to local watersheds since 2020. In 2023, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our target to
conserve and restore 12.0 billion gallons of water during the year.



Circular Economy and Waste Management

We have long been committed to waste management, recycling, and circular economy strategies that enable the recovery and productive re-use of waste streams. Our 2030
goals include a target of zero waste to landfill, as well as implementation of circular economy strategies for 60%of our manufacturing waste streams in partnership with our
suppliers. We continue to focus on opportunities to upcycle waste by improving waste segregation practices and collaborating with our suppliers to evaluate new technologies for
waste recovery. In 2023, we linked a portion of our executive and employee performance bonus to our interim target to achieve 5%of waste to landfill.

Market and Business Overview

Market Trends and Strategy

In 2023, the automotive industry grew with an approximately 9%increase in global vehicle production year over year. We expect industry ADAS volumes to grow faster than
overall global vehicle production in the coming years and anticipate long-term ADAS growth from increases in the percentage of vehicles that are equipped with basic ADAS
features from the factory. Despite our expectation for a decline in Mobileye ADAS volumes in 2024 due to a correction of inventory with our customers, we continue to believe we
will benefit from positive industry ADAS growth over the medium-term. In addition to potential volume growth, our portfolio of advanced solutions has the potential to drive higher
average system price over time.

Beyond ADAS solutions, we believe that the availability of AVs will cause a significant transformation in mobility, including vehicle ownership and utilization. We expect that AV
technology will eventually be accessed by consumers through shared-vehicle MaaS networks, as well as in consumer-owned and operated AVs. We are pursuing this market
trend by using our eyes-on/hands-off Mobileye SuperVision solution as a baseline to scale to our eyes-off/hands-off Mobileye Chauffeur consumer AV product in a variety of
operational design domains. As it relates to AMaaS, we intend to primarily go to market by supplying Mobileye DriveTM self-driving system to transportation network companies,
public transit operators, and suppliers of AV-ready vehicle platforms. In some cases, we expect to bundle our Mobileye Drive self-driving system with Moovit’s urban mobility and
transit intelligence application and its global user base.

Products and Competition

We currently ship a variety of ADAS solutions to a large number of global automakers. We are recognized for our top-rated safety solutions globally, and since 2007, we have
introduced numerous industry-first ADAS products.

We are building a robust portfolio of end-to-end ADAS and autonomous driving solutions to provide the capabilities needed for the future of autonomous driving, leveraging a
comprehensive suite of purpose-built software and hardware technologies. We pioneered “base” ADAS features to enhance vehicle safety and to meet global regulatory
requirements and safety ratings with our driver assist solution and we have since created a new category of ADAS with our Cloud-Enhanced Driver-AssistTM and premium driver
assist offerings, such as Mobileye SuperVision. By leveraging Mobileye SuperVision’s full-surround computer vision and True RedundancyTM, we are developing Mobileye
Chauffeur, our consumer AV solution and Mobileye Drive, our eyes-off/hands-off autonomous driving solution designed for fleet deployment. Our current offerings to Tier 1 and
OEM customers do not include cameras, radars, lidar systems, or other sensors (except in particular cases). We intend in the future to offer radar and lidar products that are
currently in development stages.

The ADAS and autonomous driving industries are highly competitive. In the ADAS and consumer AV market, we face competition primarily from other external providers,
including Tier 1 automotive suppliers and silicon providers, as well as in-house solutions developed by OEMs to a certain extent. Our Tier 1 customers may be developing or may
in the future develop competing solutions. In the autonomous driving market, including AMaaS and consumer AV, we face competition from technology companies; internal
development teams from the automakers themselves, sometimes in combination with investments in early-stage autonomous vehicle technology companies, Tier 1 automotive
companies, as well as robotaxi providers.

Market and Business Overview

Market Trends and Strategy

The chip industry is undergoing a structural transformation driven by:

▪
▪

▪
▪

Five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing;
A generational shift in computer architectures: the move from system on chip to system of chips (chiplets), increased tailoring of chips to workloads, especially AI, and
the vertical integration into chipmaking by OEMs and CSPs;

Increasing costs of R&D and capacity for advanced node technologies; and
Supply chain risk highlighted by geo-political issues and the growing need for a resilient, secure, and sustainable global supply chain.

These transformational trends are driving significant semiconductor market growth in leading-edge silicon and packaging technologies, especially in systems of chips for AI
applications. Customers have to make complex design choices at every level of the system, from packaging technologies, process nodes, interconnects, physical IP, and
compute elements to software. The abundance of technology choices and optimizations is adding complexity in design, technology, integration, and manufacturing.

Our IDM 2.0 strategy includes our pursuit of these complex manufacturing and market growth opportunities by making significant capital investments in leading-edge
semiconductor technologies in order to create foundry capacity and establish IFS as a major provider of foundry services that provides semiconductor manufacturing solutions for
others and for ourselves. We have made and expect to continue to make significant capital investments in furtherance of this strategy.

Products and Competition

We seek to address this tectonic shift in the chip industry by enabling our customers to create optimized systems of chips by combining the best technologies from Intel and the
ecosystem. We believe Open System Foundry is a world-class foundry offering, delivered from a resilient, secure, and sustainable source of supply and complemented by
access to the systems of chips capabilities from Intel. The basic foundry offering is advanced process technologies backed by an ecosystem of IP, EDA, and design services,
which enable customers to design as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include advanced packaging technologies, software to accelerate bringup and integration of complex chips, and driving standards that will improve system performance.

With our IFS accelerator program members and the Arm and Synopsys agreements, we believe we are well on the way to building out a world-class foundry offering. With the
rise of AI, our advanced packaging business is expected to be another unique advantage for Intel. Chips created with us or other foundries can be packaged using Intel's
advanced packaging technologies, including 2D and 2.5D/3D solutions designed to enable large, highly scalable packages at competitive costs. We continue to drive
technologies, capabilities, and standards needed to optimize systems of chips, including the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express* standard for communication between chips
in a system, which was demonstrated in silicon in 2023. We accelerate our customers' designs by providing services and software that leverage Intel's vast experience as a
systems company.

Our competitors are mostly pure-play foundries that focus on delivering a pure-play foundry offering from fabrication plants based primarily in Asia. Of the five major
semiconductor foundries, TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation
(SMIC), only Samsung is an IDM and foundry, and only GF is headquartered in the US. TSMC leads the market with 59%market share, followed by Samsung at 16%in 2022 .
Neither Samsung nor TSMC currently offers its most advanced nodes outside of Asia and both have limited advanced node capacity in the US.

We believe the Open System Foundry model delivers differentiated capabilities to help our customers lead in their industries while bringing stability to the global semiconductor
supply chain. The momentum and customer commitments we are seeing demonstrate that our strategy and offerings are resonating, and we look to build on this success in 2024
and in future periods.

Segment Revenue Walk$B

Revenue

2023 vs. 2022

2023 revenue was$54.2 billion, down$8.8 billion, or 14%, from 2022. CCG revenue decreased 8%from 2022 primarily due to lower notebook and desktop volume driven by
lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in
the first half. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the relative strength in the education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix
of older generation products, and were partially offset by higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI
revenue decreased 20%from 2022 due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, which was partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower
mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 31%from 2022 as customers tempered purchases to reduce
existing inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.

Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, contributed
approximately$700 million to our revenue during Q4 2023, the impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q1 2024, as included in our Form 8-K dated
January 25, 2024.

2022 vs. 2021

2022 revenue was$63.1 billion, down$16.0 billion, or 20%, from 2021. CCG revenue was down 23%from 2021 due to lower notebook and desktop volume in the consumer and
education market segments, and lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and
connectivity products. Notebook volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments, while ASPs increased due to the resulting product
mix. Desktop volume decreased, driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments while ASPs increased due to an increased mix of commercial
products. DCAI revenue decreased 15%from 2021 due to lower server demand from enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing
inventories in a softening data center market. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from our FPGA business. Server ASPs decreased due to customer and
product mix. NEX revenue increased 10%from 2021, driven by higher Ethernet ASPs and increased demand for 5G products, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon.
Mobileye revenue increased 35%from 2021, primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products and Mobileye Supervision systems. The decrease in our "all other" revenue
was due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of$4.3 billion recognized in 2021, for which historical results are recorded in “all other,” and$584 million of
revenue recognized in 2021 from a prepaid customer supply agreement.

Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in
CCG, contributed approximately$1.7 billion to our revenue during Q4 2022.

MD&A

We are making capital investments in furtherance of our IDM 2.0 strategy. As of December 30, 2023, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled$43.4 billion ($36.7 billion as of December 31, 2022). These assets have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. As these construction-in-progress
assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow
our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected. Additionally, we could incur asset impairments on property,
plant, and equipment assets if our IDM 2.0 strategy is not successful.

Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful life in
place as of the end of 2022, we estimate total depreciation expense in 2023 was reduced by$4.2 billion. We estimate this change resulted in an approximately$2.5 billion
increase to gross margin,$400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and$1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and
under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is included in
overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which such costs
are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. As a result, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is
included in our 2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.

Operating Expenses

Total R&D and MG&A expenses for 2023 were$21.7 billion, down 12%compared to 2022. These expenses represent 40.0%of revenue for 2023 and 38.9%of revenue for
2022. In support of our strategy, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D and
focused efforts to attract and retain talent. We have implemented certain cost-cutting measures while we continue to improve our product execution.

8.5%Our effective tax rate decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by our R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not
dependent on lower income before taxes, and a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions. Our benefit from income taxes increased in 2023 compared
to 2022 primarily due to a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions. The 2023 shift in income was attributable to the 2022 tax costs associated with the
gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and a change in tax law
from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 2022. In 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as compared to a provision
for taxes in 2021 as the higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and the change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform were only partially offset by the tax
costs associated with the gains recognized from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business.

In 2021 the OECD announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the
taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions
have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the
adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation
and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented
by our total cash and investments , is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed
credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken. Our short-term funding requirements include capital
expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and
pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion
plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, Ireland, Israel, New Mexico, and Oregon, and
investing in new leading-edge manufacturing facilities in Germany and Ohio. We also expect to continue to benefit from government incentives and any incentives above our
current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash
requirements. We expect our planned capital investments to continue to put pressure on our adjusted free cash flow in the short term.

As we invest in multiple expansions, we expect our capital expenditures to continue to be higher than historical levels for the next several years. We expect to adjust the cadence
of our investments based on the execution of our roadmap and changing business conditions. As of December 30, 2023, we had commitments for capital expenditures of$20.4
billion for 2024 and had$7.1 billion in capital expenditures committed in the long term. As of December 30, 2023, other purchase obligations and commitments in 2024 under our
binding commitments for purchases of goods and services were$2.7 billion, with an additional$5.6 billion committed in the long term.

We have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures and other purchase obligations and commitments for
purchases of goods and services. For example, see "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our
lease obligations, which include supply agreements structured as leases; "Note 8: Income Taxes" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our
tax obligations, including impacts from Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings; and "Note 13: Borrowings" within the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our debt obligations. The expected timing of payments of our obligations is estimated based on current
information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for
some obligations. In addition, some of our purchasing requirements are not current obligations and are therefore not included in the amounts above. For example, some of these
requirements are not handled through binding contracts or are fulfilled by vendors on a purchase order basis within short time horizons.

We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in
investment-grade securities.

Our sources of liquidity in 2023 included$1.5 billion from partner contributions, net proceeds of$1.6 billion from a secondary offering of Mobileye Class A common stock,$1.4 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of minority stakes in our IMS business to both Bain Capital and TSMC, and government incentives of$1.0 billion. Other potential
sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified
amount of debt, equity, other securities, and non-recourse factoring arrangements with third-party financial institutions. Under our commercial paper program, we have an
ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to$10.0 billion and, as of December 30, 2023, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding. During 2023,
we issued a total of$11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing our outstanding debt and
funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our five-year$5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement, extending that maturity date
by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day$5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. As of December 30, 2023, we had no borrowings
outstanding on the revolving credit facilities.

In Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is expected to support
the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value. In January 2024, our Board of Directors declared a
quarterly dividend of$0.125 per share on the company's common stock, which will be payable on March 1, 2024 to stockholders of record as of February 7, 2024. Future
declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash
receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. In 2023 these actions included, among others, negotiating with suppliers
to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory
levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and
may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these
actions reverse or normalize.

Our cash flows for each period were as follows:

Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

For 2023 compared to 2022, the$4.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2023 net income after adjusting for non-cash items,
partially offset by 2023 cash-favorable working capital changes compared to 2022.

For 2022 compared to 2021, the$14.0 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower 2022 net income after adjusting for non-cash items,
including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND business, partially offset by 2022 cash-favorable working capital changes
compared to 2021.

MD&A

Investing Activities

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; proceeds from capital-related government incentives; and
proceeds from divestitures. Our capital expenditures were$25.8 billion in 2023 ($24.8 billion in 2022 and$18.7 billion in 2021).

The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a lack of proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business and from the sale
of our remaining McAfee share that occurred in 2022, lower maturities and sales of short-term investments, and increased capital expenditures. These unfavorable cash flow
impacts during 2023 were partially offset by higher 2023 proceeds from capital-related government incentives and by other cash favorable investment activities, including lower
acquisitions during 2023.

The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-term investments, proceeds from the
divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.

Financing Activities

Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from partner
contributions and equity-related issuances.

The increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher debt issuances along with lower repayment of long-term debt,
decreased dividend payments to stockholders, and increased proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares, partially offset by commercial paper issuances in 2022 that were
subsequently repaid in 2023. Our total dividend payments were$3.1 billion in 2023, compared to$6.0 billion in 2022. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 125
quarters.

Cash provided by financing activities in 2022 compared to cash used for financing activities in 2021 was primarily due to higher commercial paper and debt issuances, our 2022
curtailment of common stock repurchases, proceeds from the Mobileye IPO, and partner contributions for joint investments, partially offset by higher 2022 debt repayments.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The methods, assumptions, and estimates that we use in applying our accounting policies may require us to apply judgments regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. We
consider an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) we must make assumptions that are uncertain when the judgment is made, and (2) changes in the estimate
assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made.

Refer to "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, which are as follows, as
well as our significant accounting policies:

▪

▪

▪

Inventories—the transition of manufacturing costs to inventory, net of factory excess capacity costs. Inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value
considering forecasted future demand and market conditions;

Long-lived assets—the valuation methods and assumptions used in assessing the impairment and evaluation of useful lives of property, plant, and equipment; identified
intangibles; and impairment of goodwill, including the determination of asset groupings and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting units; and

Loss contingencies—the estimation of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

MD&A

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between
periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating
our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax
effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13%across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year
non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax
positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of
reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations.
Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates
comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect this updated approach.

Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results
calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Usefulness to management and investors

NAND memory business We completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory

business to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in Q1 2022.

Acquisition-related
adjustments

Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of
amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands,
and customer relationships acquired in connection with business
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are
recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial
statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful
life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally
recorded over multiple years.

Share-based
compensation

Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee
equity incentive plans.

We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain nonGAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still pending and
subject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022
and management does not view the historical results of the business as a
part of our core operations. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core
business model and how management currently evaluates core
operational performance. In making these adjustments, we have not made
any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or
other financial statement amounts.

We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible
assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because
these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by
the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to
our past operating performance and provide investors with additional
means to evaluate cost and expense trends.

We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these
adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and
because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core
operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors
with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business
model, how management currently evaluates core operational
performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including
in comparison to other peer companies.

Patent settlement

Definition

Usefulness to management and investors

A portion of the charge from our IP settlements represents a catch-up of
cumulative amortization that would have been incurred for the right to use
the related patents in prior periods. This charge related to prior periods is
excluded from our non-GAAP results; amortization related to the right to
use the patents in the current and ongoing periods is included.

We exclude the catch-up charge related to prior periods for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment
facilitates comparison to past operating results and provides a useful
evaluation of our current operating performance.

Optane inventory
impairment

A charge in 2022 as we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane
memory business.

Restructuring and other
charges

Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring
plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit
arrangements. Other charges may include periodic goodwill and asset
impairments, certain pension charges, and costs associated with
restructuring activity. 2023 includes a benefit as a result of developments
in the VLSI litigation in Q4 2023, an EC-imposed fine, and a fee related to
the termination of our agreement to acquire Tower. 2022 includes a benefit
related to the annulled EC fine and 2021 includes a charge related to the
VLSI litigation.

We exclude these impairments for purposes of calculating certain nonGAAP measures because these charges do not reflect our current
operating performance. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of
our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating
results.

We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to
charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain nonGAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core
operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and
provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.

(Gains) losses on equity
investments, net

(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-tomarket adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price
adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment
charges, and the sale of equity investments and other.

We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because it provides better
comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management
evaluates the core operations of the business.

(Gains) losses from
divestiture

(Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a
specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the
time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer
manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first
closing of the sale of our NAND memory business on December 29, 2021,
a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be
recognized between first and second closing.

Adjusted free cash flow We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow,

which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity,
capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is
operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to property, plant, and
equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives
and partner contributions, (2) payments on finance leases, and (3)
proceeds from the McAfee equity sale in 2022.

Total cash and
investments

Total cash and investments is used by management when assessing our
sources of liquidity, which include cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and loans receivable and other.

We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our
current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful
evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past
operating results.

This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital
requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to
evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 divestiture,
McAfee equity distributions and sales contributed to prior operating and
free cash flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have
typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale, we
believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a
better, more consistent comparison to current and past presentations of
liquidity.

This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources
and liquidity position.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Risk Factors

The following summarizes the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. When any one or more of the following risks materialize from time to
time, our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations can be materially and adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could
decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations can also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to
be immaterial to our operations, or by various risks that are generally applicable to most companies. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial
results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other
information set forth in this Form 10-K, including in the MD&A and Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.

We are in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry.

The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological, geopolitical, and market developments; changes in industry standards; changes in
customer and end-user needs, expectations, and preferences; and frequent product introductions and improvements. When we do not anticipate or respond to these
developments, our competitive position can weaken, and our products or technologies can become uncompetitive or obsolete. Our competitive environment has intensified in
recent years, and we expect it to continue to do so in the future. If we are not able to compete effectively, or if our foundry strategy is unsuccessful, our financial results will be
adversely affected, including through reduced revenue and gross margin, and we may be required to accelerate the write-down of the value of certain assets.

We face intense competition across our product portfolio. Our competitors include companies offering platform products, such as AMD and Qualcomm; accelerator products such
as GPUs, including those offered by NVIDIA; other accelerator products such as ASICs, application-specific standard products, and FPGAs; memory and storage products;
connectivity and networking products; and other semiconductor products. Some of these competitors have developed or utilize competing computing architectures and platforms,
such as the ARM architecture*, and these architectures and platforms can produce beneficial network effects for competitors when an ecosystem of customers and application
developers for such architectures and platforms grows at scale. For example, ARM-based products are being used in PCs and servers, which could lead to further development
and growth of the ARM ecosystem. We also compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers.
Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads. For
example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs, and we face increasing
competition from Apple's products and ecosystem.

Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as TSMC or Samsung, for the manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products.
Manufacturing process and assembly and test improvements introduced by such foundries have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings
by our competitors. Our process technology roadmap to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025 is subject to a number of risks, and we could
fail to realize our goals, including due to changes in competitor technology roadmaps, changes affecting our projections regarding our technology or competing technology, and
the risks described in the risk factor "The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and
uncertainties." As an IDM, we have higher capital expenditures and R&D spending than many of our fabless competitors due to the high ongoing investments required to
maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity. We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry participants through, for
example, acquisitions or business collaborations, as well as new entrants, including in China, which could have a significant impact on our competitive position. For example, we
could face increased competition as a result of China's programs to promote a domestic semiconductor industry and supply chains.

Our products compete based on a number of factors, including performance, energy efficiency, ease-of-integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload
optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer
support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment. To the extent our products do not meet our customers'
requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business and results of operations can be harmed. Introduction of competitive new products and
technologies, aggressive pricing, and other actions taken by competitors can harm demand for our products, exert downward pricing pressure on our products, and adversely
affect our business. For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts
that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment. Further, our DCAI revenue, platform ASPs and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive
environment and the shift of customer spend towards GPUs during the past few years. Additionally, a number of business combinations and strategic partnerships in the
semiconductor industry have occurred in recent years, and more could occur in the future. Consolidation could also lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which
could negatively affect our financial results.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

We have limited experience in the highly competitive and capital-intensive third-party foundry business. As we pursue our strategy to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry
capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others, we will face intense competition from well-established competitors such as TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries (GF), United
Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as
availability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; multi-chip
packaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and maintaining a
competitive foundry business requires high ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances
must be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. Moreover, many of the largest potential IFS customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose
products compete with our own. As a result, our strategy requires us to overcome customer concerns regarding protection of confidentiality information, intellectual property, and
foundry capacity, among other competitive concerns, to attract and retain such customers. Our limited third-party foundry experience also means we must continue to hire and
retain talented employees with relevant foundry experience with respect to both leading-edge and legacy nodes. Our efforts may be hindered by the higher costs of, regulatory
and environmental restrictions imposed upon, and time it takes to build fabrication and assembly and test facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and plan to build new
or upgrade existing foundry facilities as compared to the jurisdictions in which our competitors predominantly operate their foundry facilities. Our construction projects to expand
capacity require available sources of labor, materials, and equipment. Increasing demand for such sources, including from other foundries; supply constraints, labor shortages,
and other adverse market conditions; issues with permits or approvals; on-site incidents; and other construction issues arise from time to time and can result in significant delays
and increased costs for our projects, as well as legal and reputational harm. These significant hurdles to our foundry strategy make it highly risky and our success highly
uncertain.

We are making significant, long-term and inherently risky investments in R&D and manufacturing facilities that may not realize a
favorable return.

To compete successfully, we must maintain an effective R&D program, develop new products and manufacturing processes, improve our products and processes, and make
significant capital investments in new and existing manufacturing facilities, all ahead of competitors and market demand. The R&D efforts and capital investments we require are
intensive as we compete across both product and process technologies. We incurred R&D expenses of$16.0 billion in 2023,$17.5 billion in 2022, and$15.2 billion in 2021. We
are focusing our R&D efforts across several key areas, including process and packaging technology, our xPU products and features, AI, and software. These include ambitious
initiatives, such as our efforts to introduce five new manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, in four years and our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools. Our
investments are typically long-term and, even where successful, often do not contribute to our operating results for a number of years. We cannot guarantee that our efforts will
deliver the benefits we anticipate, including as a result of our new products or technologies falling short of expectations or the offerings of competitors. For example, we
previously experienced significant delays in the implementation of our 10nm process technology, and during 2020, we announced that our then 7nm process technology would
be delayed relative to our prior expectations. In such instances where we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technologies that improve performance,
performance per watt, transistor density, die utilization, core counts, and/or new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, with sufficient manufacturing yields
and operational efficiency, relative to competing foundry processes, we have faced and will face cost, product performance, and time-to-market disadvantages relative to our
competitors and adverse impacts to our financial condition as a result of higher operating costs, including as a result of additional costs from unused manufacturing capacity,
higher leverage and borrowing costs, and pressure on our credit ratings. Further, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new products, including as a result of
bugs, late changes to features due to customer requests, or other design challenges. For example, in 2022, we announced that the release of Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable
processor would be delayed from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. To the extent our R&D efforts do not develop new products on schedule with improvements in
areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and/or with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive
position can be harmed. We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured
on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package. This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and
manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased
costs. Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products. For example, adapting a processor or
component design for a new or different manufacturing process involves additional R&D expense and can result in delays in the development of the associated product and
higher costs due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

The investments required for our process technology roadmap and our worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test require capital expenditures above our historical levels.
In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has seen very significant increases in the capital investments required for manufacturing facilities utilizing leading
process technologies, including as a result of the use of EUV photolithography tools. Our ownership and operation of such high-tech fabrication facilities, and our need to build
new and expand existing facilities in anticipation of future demand, has resulted and will continue to result in our incurring large capital outlays and high costs that are fixed or
difficult to reduce in the short term. Such capital outlays and costs include those related to utilization of existing facilities, facility construction and equipment, R&D, and the
employment and training of a highly skilled workforce. To the extent customers are unwilling to pay prices to access the features that our process and product investments are
expected to deliver or demand for our products, foundry capacity and assembly and test capacity decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our gross margin and
operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure, which is difficult to reduce quickly in response to lower demand and other unfavorable
market factors. We could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charges, which would also lower our gross margin and operating
income. To the extent the demand decrease is prolonged, our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized, and we may be required to write down our
long-lived assets, which would increase our expenses. We may also be required to shorten the useful lives of under-used facilities and equipment and accelerate depreciation.
As we continue to make substantial investments in increasing our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, these underutilization risks may be heightened.
Conversely, at times, demand may increase or we may fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of products demanded. To the extent we are unable to add capacity or
increase production fast enough, we are at times required to make production decisions and/or are unable to fully meet market demand, which can result in a loss of revenue
opportunities or market share, legal claims, and/or damage to customer relationships.

The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and
uncertainties.

We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies
is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials
or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our
receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially anticipated.

We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing
our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our then 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior
expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors
using third-party foundries, such as TSMC, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy
efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. Because of these prior delays in our process technologies, we may experience
greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products.

Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging
technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of nextgeneration process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D
investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our
manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses.

Risks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing
throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production
timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships.
Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products,
manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes,
can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A new process node typically has higher costs compared
to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. As the
die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and
more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and
warranty our products.

Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different
process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in
sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some
components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the
packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to
manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of
materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents,
maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could
result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business
and the results of operations.

Our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky
and do not always succeed.

Our IDM 2.0 strategy requires implementation of new business strategies, as well as many internal structural, systems and process changes. We have entered new businesses
and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitalize on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive
connectivity, cloud to edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings in areas such as discrete GPUs, mobility solutions, AI
accelerators, IPU products, and silicon photonics. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we announced plans to establish IFS as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture
semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our
individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support
the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new ERP system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant
efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as PSG and IMS, to raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities.
Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND
memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those
businesses.

These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including,
in some cases, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These
developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not
realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products
for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. Similarly, we expect intense competition
related to the significant opportunity we see in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge and may not succeed in our efforts. To be
successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is
no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on
our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.

Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements and pursuit of government grants involves risks
and may not be successful.

As we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments. To
support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our
Arizona campus, and expect to enter into similar arrangements in the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or
other terms, and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolve any
potential disputes. Any of these risks, including our ability to effectuate any additional transactions at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments.

In addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local, regional
and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions, but
there is uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of funding we may receive and as to the conditions and restrictions that may apply to us as a recipient of such funding. For
example, we expect to receive substantial grants from the US government under the CHIPS Act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in the US and the German
government under the EU Chips Act to support significant planned new fabrication facilities in Germany. However, governments may choose not to award grants and incentives
in sufficient amounts or in a timely manner to support our capital investment plans and to offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as
compared to those of many of our competitors, or we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of such grants and incentives. To the extent such funding is
below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, or we are required to return any amounts received from
any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein, our anticipated cash requirements would increase.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results.

Our products are used in different market segments, and demand for our products varies within or among them. It is difficult to forecast these changes and their impact. For
example, we expect the PC TAM to grow over time driven by factors such as a larger installed base, demand for AI capabilities, new platforms, shorter replacement cycles, and
adoption in new markets; however, the PC industry has been highly cyclical in the past, and these growth expectations may not materialize, or we may fail to capitalize on them.
Changes in the demand for our products, particularly our CCG, DCAI, and NEX platform products, have in the past and may in the future reduce our revenue, lower our gross
margin, or require us to write down the value of our assets.

Important factors that lead to variation in the demand for our products include:

▪
▪

▪
▪

▪

▪

▪

business conditions, including downturns in the market segments in which we operate, or in global or regional economies;
consumer confidence, income levels, and customer capital spending, which can be impacted by changes in market conditions, including changes in government
borrowing or spending, taxation, interest rates, the credit market, current or expected inflation, employment, and energy or other commodity prices;

geopolitical conditions, including trade policies and geopolitical tensions and conflicts;
our ability to timely introduce competitive products;

competitive and pricing pressures, including new product introductions and other actions taken by competitors;

the level of our customers' inventories and computing capacity;

customer order patterns and order cancellations, including as a result of maturing product cycles for our products, customers' products, and related products such as
operating system upgrade cycles; and disruptions affecting customers, such as the delays in obtaining tools, components, and other supplies as a result of COVID-19related port shutdowns in China that negatively impacted demand for our business in 2022, as well as the industry substrate and component shortages that negatively
impacted demand across several of our businesses in 2021;

▪ market acceptance and industry support of our products and services, including the introduction and availability of software and other products used together with our

products, such as software to harness the new AI capabilities of our latest CPUs, as well as our foundry services offerings through IFS; and

▪

customer product needs and emerging technology trends, including changes in the levels and nature of customer and end-user computing workloads, such as workand learn-from-home trends.

Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs. For
example, our core product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel
Xeon processors. Our ancillary product offerings that extend beyond our core product lines typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced products, and at
times are not profitable. To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced core products in any of our market segments, or our ancillary products represent a
greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage has decreased and may decrease again.

Macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including changes to trade policies and regulations, present
significant risks to us in many jurisdictions.

We have manufacturing, assembly and test, R&D, sales, and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in one or more geographic
areas. Our operations rely upon a supply chain that is also highly distributed, and with reliance in some instances on supplies or materials available in only one or more
geographic areas. Moreover, sales outside the US accounted for 74%of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, with revenue from billings to China
contributing 27%of our total revenue. As a result, our operations and our financial results, including our ability to execute our business strategy, manufacture, assemble and test,
design, develop, or sell products, and the demand for our products, are at times adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control.

Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically occur, including recession or slowing growth; changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy;
higher interest rates; tighter credit; inflation; lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure; increases in unemployment; and lower consumer confidence
and spending. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and
make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and
collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital and credit markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties,
including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Trade policies and disputes at times result in increased tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist measures, which can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products
less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, or impede or slow the
movement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policies and regulations, domestic sourcing
initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets. They can also result in declining
consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. Sustained
geopolitical tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, domestic sourcing initiatives, and decoupling of global trade networks, which
could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and have a material adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.

In particular, geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable
to some of our products, and have affected customer ordering patterns. Further, the US has imposed restrictions on the export of US-regulated products and technology to
certain Chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. Specifically, in 2022 the US significantly increased US export controls on semiconductor
manufacturing equipment and on artificial intelligence and advanced computing products. In 2023, the US added to the restrictions in all three areas and also worked with Japan
and the Netherlands to align on additional restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. During this time, the US has increasingly added Chinese companies to
prohibited lists. In response, China has restricted US access to certain minerals and has blocked certain companies that provide products to Taiwan's military from selling
products in China. These restrictions have in some instances reduced our sales and in a number of instances required specific governmental authorizations or exceptions -$3.2 billion, or 6%, of our 2023 revenue was dependent upon US government export control authorizations, an amount that we expect may increase in future years. These and
potential future restrictions could adversely affect our financial performance and result in reputational harm to us. In addition, a number of semiconductor companies in China,
including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), are making significant investments, in many instances with the support of the Chinese government, in
advanced semiconductor technologies to enable such companies to develop products and technologies that compete with ours. It is difficult to predict what further trade-related
actions governments may take, the extent to which we may be able to mitigate the effects of any such actions, and the longer-term implications of such actions on the market
opportunities for us and the competition we may face.

We can also be adversely affected by other global and regional factors that periodically occur, including:

▪

▪
▪

▪

▪

▪

▪
▪

▪

▪

▪

geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, human rights concerns, and terrorist activity, including, for
example:

▪

▪

▪

Russia’s war with Ukraine, initiated in 2022, which resulted: in the imposition of financial and other sanctions and export controls against Russia and Belarus
that caused us and other companies to limit or suspend Russian operations (we had no exports to Russia in 2023); Russia-imposed currency restrictions and
regulations and other retaliatory trade and other actions; increased supply, commodity, and other costs; and increased risk of cyberattacks;

tensions and conflict affecting Israel, where we have multiple semiconductor development centers and a leading-edge manufacturing facility and where our
Mobileye business is headquartered and has most of its operations, and in surrounding areas, such as past conflicts in Lebanon and the current conflict in the
Red Sea; and

rising tensions between China and Taiwan;

natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), and other catastrophic events;
inefficient infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions, materials shortages or delays, and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of
services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;

formal or informal imposition of new or revised export, import, or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and changes in the ability to obtain export
licenses, which could be changed without notice;

government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or
other funds in a particular country;

adverse changes relating to government grants, tax credits, or other government incentives, including more favorable incentives provided to competitors;

differing employment practices and labor issues, including restricted access to talent;
ineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;

local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;

continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the US and abroad; and

fluctuations in the market values of our domestic and international investments, and in the capital and credit markets, which can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit
deterioration or losses, interest rate changes, financial results, political risk, sovereign risk, or other factors.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

We are subject to numerous risks associated with the evolving market for products with AI capabilities.

The markets and use cases for products with AI capabilities have been rapidly evolving, are difficult to predict and may impact demand for our products. For example, in the last
few years the demand for high-end GPUs for model training increased dramatically and has resulted and may continue to result in a significant shift in DCAI customer spend. The
significant investments we have made to develop products and software to address what we believe will be increasing demand for AI capabilities may be insufficient, and we face
significant hurdles, including whether demand will materialize, whether third-party developers will develop the software to utilize the AI capabilities of our products, and whether
we will be successful in developing products that can compete with offerings by established competitors.

Our use of AI technology may subject us to reputational, financial, legal, or regulatory risks. As we incorporate AI technology into our products and services, any failure to
address concerns relating to the responsible use of the evolving AI technology in our products and services may cause harm to our reputation or financial liability and, as such,
may increase our costs to address or mitigate such risks and issues. AI technology may create ethical issues, generate defective algorithms, and present other risks that create
challenges with respect to its adoption. In addition, evolving rules, regulations, and industry standards governing AI may require us to expend significant resources to modify,
maintain, or align our business practices or products to comply with US and non-US rules and regulations, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. Several
jurisdictions around the globe, including the EU and certain US states, have already proposed or enacted laws governing AI. US federal agencies are likely to release AI
regulations in the near future in light of the Biden administration’s October 30, 2023 Executive Order on AI. The regulatory environment surrounding the impact of the
implementation of AI on our products and services may adversely affect our ability to produce and export products and as a result may cause harm to our reputation and financial
liability.

We rely upon a complex global supply chain.

We have a highly complex global supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers. These suppliers provide direct materials for our production processes; supply tools,
equipment, and IP (via licenses) for our factories; deliver logistics and packaging services; and supply software, lab and office equipment, and other goods and services used in
our business. We also rely on suppliers to provide certain components for our products and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our components and products. From
time to time, we are negatively impacted by supply chain issues, including:

▪

▪

▪

▪

▪

suppliers extending lead times, experiencing capacity constraints, limiting or canceling supply, allocating supply to other customers including competitors, delaying or
canceling deliveries, or increasing prices;
supplier quality issues;

cybersecurity events, IP or other litigation, man-made or natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics), operational failures, or other events that disrupt
suppliers;
long lead times to qualify alternate or additional suppliers, or the unavailability of qualified alternate suppliers; and

increased legislation, regulation, or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices, such as heightened reporting and other obligations with regard to
environmental impacts, the risk of forced labor, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, which can result in supply chain disruptions, the loss of a
supplier, and the government seizure of goods.

These and other supply chain issues can increase our costs, disrupt or reduce our production, delay our product shipments, prevent us from meeting customer demand, damage
our customer relationships, or negatively affect our reputation. They may keep us from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business,
competitive position, results of operation, and financial condition. From time to time, our customers experience disruptions or shortages in their own supply chains that constrain
their demand for our products. During the past several years, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as outbreaks of COVID-19, caused supply chain disruptions
and delays in obtaining tools and other components, and the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortages of substrates and other components and available
foundry manufacturing capacity. These shortages have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our businesses, and have adversely affected
customer demand for our products, as some customers have been unable to procure sufficient quantities of third-party components used together with our products to produce
finished systems. It is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortages when they occur.

To obtain future supply of certain materials and components, particularly substrates, and third-party foundry manufacturing capacity, we have entered into arrangements with
some of our suppliers that involve long-term purchase commitments and/or large prepayments. These arrangements may not be adequate to meet our requirements, or our
suppliers may fail to deliver committed volumes on time or at all, or their financial condition may deteriorate. If future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangements
falls below our expectations, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, unneeded capacity, and increased costs, and our prepayments may not be fully utilized, and in some
cases may not be fully recoverable.

We utilize third-party foundries and component suppliers to manufacture or supply certain components and products for areas such as networking, communications, graphics,
programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory. As part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to increase our use of third-party foundries. Delays in the development of
foundries’ future manufacturing processes could delay the introduction of products or components we design for such processes, and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent
us from meeting customer demand. We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, yields, quality, product quantities, and
costs for components and products that are manufactured by third parties.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information


Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply. However, for certain components, services, materials, and equipment, we rely on a single or a limited number of
suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location, which can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us. For example, ASML
Holding N.V. (ASML) is currently the sole supplier of EUV photolithography tools that we are deploying in our Intel 4 and subsequent manufacturing process nodes. These tools
are highly complex to develop and produce, and increasingly costly, and from time to time there are increases in lead times or delays in their development and availability, which
could delay the development or ramp of our future process nodes. As a further example, a limited number of third-party foundries offer leading-edge manufacturing processes,
and these providers are geographically concentrated in Asia. Supplier consolidation or business failures can also reduce the pool of qualified suppliers.

We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.

From time to time, we identify product defects, errata, and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and
test processes. Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or gain through acquisitions, can also contain defects. Product issues also
sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software. We face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include
our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata. These risks may increase as our products are
introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and
other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.

Costs from defects, errata, or other product issues could include:

▪

▪
▪

▪

▪

▪

▪

writing off some or all of the value of inventory;

recalling products that have been shipped;
providing product replacements or modifications;

providing consideration to customers, including reimbursement for certain costs they incur;

defending against litigation and/or paying resulting damages;

paying fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and

reputational harm.

These costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin, and/or result in delay or loss of revenue. Mitigation techniques designed to address product
issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis—or at all—and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues
for all applications. We and third parties, such as hardware and software vendors, make prioritization decisions about which product issues to address, which can delay, limit, or
prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation and result in costs. Product defects, errata, or other product issues and/or mitigation techniques can
result in product failures, adverse performance and power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system
behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and other issues. Product issues can
damage our reputation, negatively affect product demand, delay product releases or deployment, result in legal liability, or make our products less competitive, which could harm
our business and financial results. Subsequent events or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of a product issue. In addition, our liability
insurance coverage has certain exclusions or may not adequately cover liabilities incurred. Our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim, and losses not
covered by insurance could be large, which could harm our financial condition.

We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.

We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products, as well as the operating systems and workloads that run on them
and the components that interact with them. Components and IP we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products, as well as industry-standard specifications we
implement in our products, are also regularly subject to security vulnerabilities. Our processors and other products are being used in application areas that create new or
increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure
and automotive applications. The security vulnerabilities identified in our processors include a category known as side-channel vulnerabilities, such as the variants referred to as
"Spectre" and "Meltdown." Additional categories and variants have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified. Publicity about these and other security
vulnerabilities has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities. Security and manageability features
in our products cannot make our products absolutely secure, and these features themselves are subject to vulnerabilities and attempts by third parties to identify additional
vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the
ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited. Subsequent events or new information can
develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, including additional information learned as we develop and deploy mitigations or updates, become
aware of additional variants, evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new products, and address future warranty or other claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as
well as developments in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Mitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities in our products, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always
available on a timely basis—or at all—and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on
third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability,
effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to
develop and deploy mitigations. Export restrictions may impede our ability to provide updates or patches to customers in certain geographies or that appear on sanctions lists,
potentially leaving systems unpatched and open to exploitation. Further, sanctions lists may include third parties with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability
disclosure, which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerabilities and to deliver mitigations for them. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions
about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Security vulnerabilities and/or
mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable
system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of
data by third parties.

Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships,
prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. For example, whether or not vulnerabilities involve attempted or successful exploits, they may
result in our incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, defending against product claims and litigation,
responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, providing product replacements or modifications, or taking other
remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce
demand for our products and services. These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can
be more effectively mitigated in competing products. Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are
available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.

We are subject to increasing and evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy risks.

We face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks; the complexity,
technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the attractiveness of our systems, products and processes to threat actors
(including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer
impacts of a material cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services and components. Such an incident, whether or not successful, could result in our
incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding our internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing
modifications to our products and services, defending against litigation or enforcement proceedings, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business
relationship with us, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. We regularly face attempts by malicious
attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our suppliers, customers, partners, end users, or other third parties; steal proprietary, personal, or
confidential information related to our business, products, employees, suppliers, or customers; introduce malicious software to our systems or those of our suppliers, customers,
partners, end users, or other third parties; interrupt our systems and services or those of our suppliers, customers, or others; or demand ransom to return control of such systems
and services. As we grow certain emerging business lines, such as our foundry business and our cloud computing and software-as-a-service offerings, we expect to collect or
host significant amounts of highly sensitive customer data, which may increasingly make us a target of attempts to steal or corrupt that data. Individuals and organizations,
including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, insider threats including employees and third-party service providers, and intruders into our physical facilities, at
times attempt to gain unauthorized access to and/or corrupt the processes used to design and manufacture our hardware products and our associated software and services. We
are also a frequent target of attackers that intend to sabotage, compromise, take control of, or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes, products, and services. In
some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services may be unaware of a threat or incident or its magnitude and effects, or we may be
unable to timely mitigate the impacts of an incident.

Cyber attack attempts are increasing in number, magnitude, and technical sophistication, and if successful may expose us and the affected parties to loss or misuse of
proprietary or confidential information or disruptions to our business operations, including our manufacturing operations, and could impact our financial results. We expect
emerging technologies to contribute to the increasing sophistication of attacks and to lead to new threats. For example, threat actors may leverage emerging AI technologies to
develop new hacking tools and attack vectors, exploit vulnerabilities, obscure their activities, and increase the difficulty of threat attribution.

As a developer of leading-node processes and widely utilized products, we have been, and expect to continue to be, the subject of intense efforts by sophisticated cyber
adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, who seek to compromise our systems, disrupt our operations or those of users of our products, or steal trade secrets. As
geopolitical or armed global conflicts escalate, attacks against us, our customers, or our strategic allies may similarly intensify. For example, from 2019 to 2021, we, along with
other companies with meaningful operations in Israel, were targets of concerted cyberattacks. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our Habana Labs subsidiary’s network was breached
in connection with a suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack, resulting in unauthorized third-party access of certain confidential information.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

We are also subject to risks associated with attacks on products, services and components in our supply chain, such as the 2020 compromise of IT infrastructure management
software provided by SolarWinds Corporation. These providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can
impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information. Since 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In
December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j* 2, and similar vulnerabilities affecting commonly used
programs and tools were reported in 2022 and 2023.

We are required to comply with stringent, complex, and evolving laws, rules, regulations, and standards in many jurisdictions, as well as contractual obligations, relating to
cybersecurity and data privacy. Our compliance efforts are complicated by the fact that these requirements and obligations may be subject to uncertain or inconsistent
interpretations and enforcement, and may conflict among various jurisdictions. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards,
certifications, or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition,
disclosure, release, or transfer of personal information, may result in outcomes such as: requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices; the expenditure of
substantial costs, time, and other resources; proceedings or actions against us; legal liability; governmental investigations; enforcement actions; claims; fines; judgments;
awards; penalties; sanctions; and potentially costly litigation (including class actions).

The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business, including data stored with vendors or other third parties, could result
in significantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Costs to comply with and implement privacy-related and data-protection
measures are significant, and noncompliance could expose us to significant monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, suspension of online services or sites in certain
countries, and even criminal sanctions. Even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data-protection laws and regulations could
result in audits, regulatory inquiries, or proceedings against us by governmental entities or other third parties.

We are subject to IP risks, including related litigation and regulatory proceedings.

We cannot always protect our IP or enforce our IP rights. We regard our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other IP rights as important to the success of our business. We
rely on IP law—as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers, employees, technology development partners, and others—to protect our IP and IP rights.
Our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our IP rights in various countries and other geopolitical
factors. We are not always able to obtain protection for our IP or enforce or protect our IP rights. When we seek to enforce our rights, we may be subject to claims that our IP
rights are invalid, not enforceable, or licensed to an opposing party. Our assertion of IP rights may result in another party seeking to assert claims against us, which could harm
our business. From time to time, governments adopt regulations—and governments or courts render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of IP rights, or governments
require products to meet standards that favor local companies. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances can harm our competitive position and
business. In some cases, our IP rights can offer inadequate protection for our innovations. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other
confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in R&D, product
development, and marketing could be reduced. This risk is heightened as competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employees.

Our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives at times allow competitors to use some of our patent rights. Technology companies often bilaterally
license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements. Some of our competitors have in the past had, and may in the future have, licenses to
some of our patents, and under current case law, some of the licenses can exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances. Our participation in
industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives at times requires us to offer to license our patents to companies that adopt industry-standard specifications.
Depending on the rules of the organization, government regulations, or court decisions, we sometimes have to grant licenses to some of our patents for little or no cost, and as a
result, we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others, and the value of our IP rights may be impaired.

Third parties assert claims based on IP rights against us and our products, which could harm our business. We face claims based on IP rights from individuals, companies,
investment litigation entities, other non-practicing entities, academic and research institutions, and other parties. We have seen an increase in patent assertions and lawsuits
initiated by well-funded non-practicing entities, including entities funded by third-party investment firms. These lawsuits can increase our cost of doing business, impact our
reputation or relationship with customers, and could disrupt our operations if they succeed in blocking the trade of our products. The patent litigation environment has also
become more challenging due to the emergence of venues adopting procedural and substantive rules that make them more favorable for patent asserters and courts in which
injunctions are available for non-competitors. As a result, we believe we are facing a more hostile IP litigation environment than in past years.

We are typically engaged in a number of disputes involving IP rights. Claims that our products, technologies, or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their
merits, cause us to incur large costs to respond to, defend, and resolve the claims, and they divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our
business and operations. In addition, we may face claims based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets, confidential information, or
end-user data that we obtain in conducting our business. Any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of
product recalls and returns, and reputational harm. Furthermore, in many instances we agree to indemnify customers for certain IP rights claims against them. IP rights claims
against our customers could also limit demand for our products or disrupt our customers' businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

As a result of IP rights claims, we could:

▪

▪

▪

▪

pay monetary damages, payments to satisfy indemnification obligations, royalties, fines, or penalties;

stop manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products or technology subject to claims;

need to develop other products or technology not subject to claims, which could be time-consuming or costly; and/or

enter into settlement or license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms and may be costly.

These IP rights claims could harm our competitive position, result in expenses, or require us to impair our assets. If we alter or stop production of affected items, our revenue
could be harmed.

We rely on access to third-party IP, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Many of our products are designed to include third-party
technology or implement industry standards, which may require licenses from third parties. In addition, from time to time, third parties notify us that they believe we are using their
IP. There is no assurance that any necessary licenses or our existing licenses to such third-party IP can be obtained or are available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Failure to obtain the right to use third-party technology, or to license IP on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. To the extent our products include software that contains or is derived from open-source software, we
may be required to make the software's source code publicly available and/or license the software under open-source licensing terms.

We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer,
competition, commercial, IP, labor and employment, compliance, and other issues. As described in "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings,
excessive verdicts, or other events could occur, including monetary damages, fines, penalties, or injunctions stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging
in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome can result in a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our
operations, harmful to our reputation, and distracting to management.

We must attract, retain, and motivate key talent.

We believe that hiring and retaining qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical talent, sales representatives, and other professionals are critical to our business. The
competition for highly skilled employees in our industry is intense, with the demand often exceeding supply. Competitors for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our
employees, and the availability of flexible, hybrid, or work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. In addition, changes in immigration policies
may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent. From time to time, we have intensified our efforts to recruit
and retain talent, such as during 2021 and 1H 2022, and these efforts have increased our expenses. Further, we may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the
workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy, and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring and reduce our workforce to respond to business conditions that differ
from our expectations, which can be disruptive, compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goals, and impact our ability to recruit in the future. Changes in
employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. To help
attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, we use share-based awards, such as RSUs, and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock
price or lower stock price performance relative to our competitors have been reducing the retention value of our share-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of
our compensation. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of
choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, or changes in our workforce and related restructuring, reduction-in-force
or other initiatives are not viewed favorably, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees can be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition,
significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to
the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise. Changes in our management team and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key talent could disrupt our
business and adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent we do not effectively hire, onboard, retain, and motivate key employees, our business can be harmed.

We are subject to risks associated with our strategic transactions and investments.

We routinely evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions, which are an important component of our
financial allocation strategy. These transactions involve numerous risks, including:

▪

▪

▪
▪

▪

▪

our inability to identify opportunities in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us;

failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of its anticipated benefits to materialize;

disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management's attention;
failure of partners to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely;

our inability to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding a project, property, or entity;

failure to complete a transaction in a timely manner, or at all, due to our inability to obtain required government or other approvals on a timely basis or without materially
burdensome conditions or mandated acquisitions, divestitures, or disposals, IP disputes or other litigation, difficulty in obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us, or
other unforeseen factors;

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

▪

▪

▪

▪

▪
▪

▪

our failure to realize a satisfactory return on our investment, potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other assets, and restructuring charges;

our inability to effectively enter new market segments through our strategic transactions or retain customers and partners of acquired businesses;

our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority-owned businesses or our difficulty in integrating or separating employees, business systems, and technology
or otherwise operating the acquired or majority-owned business;

controls, processes, and procedures of acquired or majority-owned businesses that do not adequately ensure compliance with laws and regulations and create
complexity and inconsistency in application of controls, processes and procedures, and our failure to identify and/or address compliance issues, including accounting
errors, or liabilities;

our inability to resolve impasses or disputes with partners, including as a result of differences in our interests or goals;
our failure to identify, or our underestimation of, commitments, liabilities, accounting and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets, majority-owned
businesses or novel transactions; and

the potential for our transactions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition,
divestiture or partial divestiture, or several concurrent strategic transactions. Moreover, our resources are limited and our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs;
accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we at times need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or otherwise investing our resources in a manner that
could help us achieve our financial or strategic objectives.

Where an existing investment does not strategically align to our key priorities, we routinely evaluate opportunities for possible divestitures and other options. We may not realize
the anticipated benefits of divestitures due to risks that include unfavorable prices and terms; changes in market, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions affecting the regions
or industries in which we or counterparties operate; changes in applicable laws; failure to receive regulatory or governmental approvals; limitations or restrictions due to
regulatory or governmental approvals, litigation, contractual terms, or other conditions; delays in closing; lack of support by third parties; actions by competitors; adverse effects
on our business relationships, operating results, or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transactions; and continued financial obligations, unanticipated
liabilities, or transition costs associated with such transactions. In some cases, we are not able to divest investments on acceptable terms or at all.

In addition, we make investments in public and private companies to further our strategic and financial objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These
companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our
initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return in a timely fashion, if at all. Our ability to realize a return on our investment in a private company, if any, is
typically dependent on the company participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not
successful, which at times includes bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment.

We are subject to sales-related risks.

We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties. We sell a significant portion of our products through third parties, such as distributors, value-added
resellers, and channel partners (collectively referred to as distributors), as well as OEMs and ODMs. We depend on many distributors to help us create end-customer demand,
provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. At times, we rely on one or more key distributors for a
product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. Our ability to add or
replace distributors for some of our products is limited. In addition, our distributors' expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our
products is not always easily transferable to a new distributor; as a result, end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor. Using third
parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure and concentration, credit, and compliance risks. Distributors and other third parties often sell
products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. From time to time, they may
face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Further, any violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business, including subjecting us to litigation or regulatory risk.
Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.

From time to time, our products are resold by third parties in an unauthorized "gray market." Our policies and procedures designed to keep our products away from the gray
market may not be successful in achieving this objective. Gray market products can distort demand and pricing dynamics in our distribution channel and certain geographies,
which at times adversely affects our revenue opportunities. Gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging. Gray market products
also sometimes include parts that have been altered or damaged, and our reputation may be harmed when these products fail or are found to be substandard.

We receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers. Collectively, our three largest customers accounted for 40%of our net revenue in 2023, 42%of our net revenue in 2022 and 43%of our net revenue in 2021. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the
foreseeable future.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly
hyperscalers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent an increasingly demanding computing environment. The further
consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration
and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance;
energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be
eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including serving cloud service provider
customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCAI in 2023 and 2022.

Some cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific
computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract
hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has
also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads from their own internal data center
infrastructures to cloud service providers. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or
cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.

The loss of key customers, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our
results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For information about our customers who accounted for greater than 10%of our net consolidated revenue,
see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from both US and non-US governments associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our
products and services, and we are seeking to increase our sales of products and services to governmental entities in the future. Government demand and payment are often
affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations, and can be
adversely impacted by shutdowns of the US federal government. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration,
and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on
accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, customers, and/or employees, and failure or inability to comply with these rules could result in civil and
criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.

We face risks related to our debt obligations.

As we pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we have incurred significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to fully
implement our strategy. As of December 30, 2023, we had$50.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and other borrowings outstanding. In addition,
we have a commercial paper program of up to$10.0 billion and credit facilities to backstop these programs and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to$10.0 billion. As we continue to pursue our IDM 2.0 strategy, we expect to incur additional indebtedness, refinance our existing debt, and issue additional notes or other debt
securities in the future at a variety of interest rates, maturities, and terms. The semiconductor industry is a cyclical business and our revenue, cash flows, and outlook often
fluctuate in accordance with this cycle, as well as prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our business strategy, and other risks described in these risk factors. These fluctuations,
together with our debt level and related debt service obligations, could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and
economic conditions and increasing the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing
costs. We may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions, or other
general corporate purposes, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond
our control. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to finance
our business strategy and service and repay outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and the cost of
borrowing.

We have significantly reduced our return of capital to stockholders in recent years.

In recent years, we have not made repurchases of our stock and reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends
at the current level, or at all. In addition, we are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program and there can be no assurances as to the amount,
timing, and execution of any future share repurchases, or that any repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Laws and regulations can have a negative impact on our business.

We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions and affect our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP
ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy and localization
requirements; competition; advertising; employment and labor; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such
requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. For example, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and
regulations worldwide related to 5G or autonomous driving technology and MaaS may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, or negatively impact our long-term expectations
for our investments in these areas. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data-protection measures could adversely affect our customers and
their products and services, particularly in cloud, Internet of Things, and AI applications, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.

Our policies, controls, and procedures designed to help provide for compliance with applicable laws cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or
agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees;
prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can
increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.

We are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

We are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our sales occur in US dollars, expenses may be paid in local
currencies. An increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the US where we sell in dollars, and a
weakened dollar can increase the cost of expenses such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, as well as non-US dollar capital expenditures. We also conduct certain
investing and financing activities in local currencies. Our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange
rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates can harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our net income.

A number of factors can impact our future effective tax rate or cash payments, which could cause significant variability in our financial results including:

▪

▪

▪

▪
▪

▪

▪
▪

▪

▪
▪

changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;

changes in our business or legal entity operating model;

the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;

changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;
adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of tax returns;

increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;

changes in available tax credits, including non-US tax credits, R&D credits and refundable tax credits;
expirations or changes in our ability to secure new tax holidays and incentives;

changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including the global implementation of a minimum tax under Pillar Two of the OECD BEPS
initiative;

changes in US GAAP; and
our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for incremental taxes including any local country withholding taxes incurred upon
repatriation.

Catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.

Our operations and business, and those of our customers and suppliers, can be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues and global pandemics
such as COVID 19; cybersecurity incidents; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation restrictions or disruptions, telecommunications, or IT systems providers;
manufacturing equipment failures; geopolitical conflict; terrorism; or other catastrophic events. For example, we have at times experienced disruptions in our manufacturing
processes as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, and disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, including cybersecurity incidents affecting
our suppliers. Our headquarters and many of our operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change can
result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the
availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities, including our facilities located in water-sensitive regions such as Arizona and Israel. In addition, to the
extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resources, our reputation could be harmed. In recent years, the west coast of the US has experienced
significant wildfires, including in Oregon, where we have major manufacturing facilities, and in California, where we are headquartered. The long-term effects of climate change
on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Catastrophic events including global pandemics could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our
suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. The COVID-19
pandemic previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical patterns related to demand for our products and services that may impact
our ability to accurately predict future demand, trends, or other matters that may impact our financial performance. While we maintain business recovery plans, some of our
systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from such disruptions. Furthermore, even if our operations are unaffected or recover
quickly, if our customers or suppliers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, we may experience reduced or cancelled orders or disruptions to our
supply chain that may adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health, safety, and product regulations.

The design, manufacturing, assembly and test of our products require the use and purchase of materials and chemicals that are subject to a broad array of environmental,
health, and safety laws and regulations. Our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations prohibiting the use of forced labor (e.g., mining conflict
minerals), and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and use of our real
property. The scope and interpretation of such laws and regulations, including the materials they govern, are complex and continue to evolve. The procedures and processes in
place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and cannot guarantee compliance by employees or third parties to whom such
laws apply. The amendment or expansion of these laws or regulations, as well as our failure or inability to comply with them (including as a result of acquired entities) can result
in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; increased costs; additional remediation obligations; suspension of production; alteration, suspension, or termination of our
manufacturing and assembly and test processes, including due to an inability to find, afford, or attain adequate substitute materials, equipment, or processes; damage to our
reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. In addition, the failure or inability to comply by our suppliers of these materials can require us to suspend or alter our
production processes and sources, and result in increased risks and costs.

The failure or inability by us or our customers and suppliers to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials can
lead to increased costs or future liabilities. Environmental regulations, including with respect to the materials and processes we are permitted to use and as to air quality and
wastewater requirements, may impede our ability to manufacture products or expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future. Environmental laws and regulations
sometimes require us to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, cease the use of a particular material or process, remove or
remediate hazardous substances, or incur other expenses or liabilities. Regulations in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with
air pollution requirements. For example, semiconductor manufacturing uses perfluorocarbons, which have historically made up a large portion of our direct greenhouse gas
emissions. New or increased regulations limiting the use of such compounds, or other greenhouse gas emissions, could require us to install additional abatement equipment,
purchase carbon offsets, and/or alter, where feasible, our production processes and sources. In addition, new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy
costs, for example as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities. Regulations in response to human health concerns may also limit or prohibit the use of a class of
chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials used in semiconductor
manufacturing. Such chemicals are critical to the manufacturing and functioning of many semiconductor products and there are limited technically and commercially feasible
alternatives to them. As we expand our manufacturing capacity as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy, the impacts of future regulation could be magnified. Many new materials that we
are evaluating for use in our operations are also subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could harm our business and results of
operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes.

Our initiatives and new legal requirements with respect to corporate responsibility matters present various risks.

Our corporate responsibility initiatives, including our RISE strategy and related goals, could expose us to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial, legal, reputational,
operational, compliance, and other risks, including lost customer opportunities, which could negatively impact us. Our achievement of initiatives, aspirations, and goals related to
corporate responsibility matters, including those related to sustainability, is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous conditions, risks, and expectations; as well as standards,
processes, and methodologies that continue to evolve. Further, any failure to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiatives that meet our stakeholders' evolving expectations
could also negatively impact us.

In addition, we are or expect to become subject to various new or proposed climate-related and other sustainability laws and regulations, including, for example, the state of
California's new climate change disclosure requirements, the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and proposed climate-change disclosure requirements from
the SEC. Compliance with such laws and regulations, as well as the overall increased focus and scrutiny from the SEC and other regulators, investors, customers, vendors,
employees, and other stakeholders concerning ESG and climate matters, could impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks, including resulting in changes to our
current ESG goals.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Sales and Marketing

Customers

We sell our products primarily to OEMs, ODMs, and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers.
In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers
who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. For information on customers who accounted for greater than 10%of our net
consolidated revenue, see "Note 3: Operating Segments" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel processors and other products from our distributors.
Certain of our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets.

Sales Arrangements

Our products are sold through distribution channels throughout the world. Sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard
terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing, payment terms, and warranties, as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products, such as patent and copyright
indemnities. Because our customers generally order from us on a purchase order basis, they can typically cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little or
no notice to us and without penalty. From time to time, we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering, for example, changes from our standard terms and
conditions, new product development and marketing, and private-label branding. Our sales are routinely made using electronic and web-based processes that allow customers to
review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered. Pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors. We also offer
discounts, rebates, and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology.

In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our
facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms. Our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due
at a later date, usually 30 days after shipment or delivery. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit
limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.
Credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy, fraud, or other failure of the customer to pay.

Our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold
merchandise. Under the price protection program, we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer. Our products
typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection, nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted. The right of return granted
generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors can exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor.

Distribution

Distributors typically handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Customers may place orders directly
with us or through distributors. We have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers.

Seasonal Trends

Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth
quarter. In 2021, continued strong COVID-driven notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. In 2022, we had a flatter
trend than we historically observe as we experienced the uncertainty and impacts, including demand volatility and supply chain disruption, of macroeconomic conditions, the
potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns. In 2023, our net revenue seasonality was more consistent with our historical prepandemic trend.

Marketing

®

Our global marketing objectives are to build a strong, well-known, differentiated, and meaningful Intel corporate brand that drives preference with businesses and consumers,
and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases. The
Intel Core processor family and the Intel Atom, Celeron , Pentium , Intel MovidiusTM, and Intel Xeon trademarks make up our key CPU brands. This year we introduced our new
Intel CoreTM Ultra processors, powering the latest AI PCs, and our 5th Gen Intel Xeon processors, built with AI acceleration in every core. We also continue to bring to market
new software services including independent attestation security with Intel Trust Authority, Intel GranulateTM for workload compute optimization, and Intel Developer Cloud to
accelerate AI development. Our foundry services business aims to offer leading-edge packaging and process technology, geographically balanced manufacturing capacity and a
world-class IP portfolio.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information


 
We promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing, as well as through co-marketing programs. Our direct marketing activities
primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as consumer and trade events, industry and consumer communications, and press relations.
We market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for our products. Our key messaging focuses on increased
performance, improved energy efficiency, and other capabilities such as connectivity.

Certain customers participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs. These cooperative advertising and marketing programs broaden the reach of our brands
beyond the scope of our own direct marketing. Certain customers are licensed to place Intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor
technologies, and to use our brands in their marketing activities. The program partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring Intel brands, subject to
customers meeting defined criteria. These marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television, as well as press relations. We have
also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may
not eliminate, the impacts of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022. Actual results may differ materially.

Currency Exchange Rates

We are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-US-dollar-denominated investments in debt and equity instruments, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign
currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-US-currency investments are generally offset by
corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.

Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in US dollars. However, a portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the
Israeli shekel, the Malaysian ringgit, the European Union euro, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect
against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-US-dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-US-dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge
currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards or option contracts
in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse
change of 10%in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting
recorded monetary asset and liability positions outstanding as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, would result in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less
than$53 million and less than$64 million, respectively.

Interest Rates

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and
provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on
our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns. We also entered into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into
floating-rate coupon payments for a portion of our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the
related hedging instruments.

A hypothetical change in benchmark interest rates of 1%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our investment
portfolio of less than$100 million as of December 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022.

Taking into account fixed-rate debt that is swapped to floating-rate debt, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 1%would result in an increase in annual interest expense of
approximately$120 million from debt outstanding as of December 30, 2023 (a hypothetical increase of 1%would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of
approximately$120 million from debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022).

Equity Prices

We are exposed to equity market risk through our investments in marketable equity securities, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities.

As of December 30, 2023, the fair value of our marketable equity securities was$1.2 billion ($1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022). The substantial majority of our marketable
equity securities portfolio as of December 30, 2023 was concentrated in securities traded on the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board.
To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity securities, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio.
Assuming a decline of 35%in market prices, the aggregate value of our marketable equity securities could decrease by$418 million, based on the value as of December 30,
2023 (a decrease in value of$670 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2022 using an assumed decline of 50%).

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

We utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair
value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.

Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the
impacts directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood
of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as IPOs, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and
there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity
securities had a carrying amount of$4.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($4.6 billion as of December 31, 2022) and include our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of$1.1 billion ($1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022).

Commodity Price Risk

Although we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction
risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging
programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for our key commodities.

Cybersecurity

We face significant and persistent cybersecurity risks due to: the breadth of geographies, networks, and systems we must defend against cybersecurity attacks; the complexity,
technical sophistication, value, and widespread use of our systems, products and processes; the attractiveness of our systems, products and processes to threat actors
(including state-sponsored organizations) seeking to inflict harm on us or our customers; the substantial level of harm that could occur to us and our customers were we to suffer
impacts of a material cybersecurity incident; and our use of third-party products, services and components. We are committed to maintaining robust governance and oversight of
these risks and to implementing mechanisms, controls, technologies, and processes designed to help us assess, identify, and manage these risks. While we have not, as of the
date of this Form 10-K, experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, there can be no guarantee that we
will not experience such an incident in the future. Such incidents, whether or not successful, could result in our incurring significant costs related to, for example, rebuilding our
internal systems, writing down inventory value, implementing additional threat protection measures, providing modifications or replacements to our products and services,
defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, providing customers with incentives to maintain a business relationship with us, or
taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties, as well as incurring significant reputational harm. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing
the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. We have seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and
sophistication. We seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network, products, and services, and to prevent their occurrence and recurrence
where practicable through changes or updates to our internal processes and tools and changes or updates to our products and services; however, we remain potentially
vulnerable to known or unknown threats. In some instances, we, our suppliers, our customers, and the users of our products and services can be unaware of a threat or incident
or its magnitude and effects. Further, there is increasing regulation regarding responses to cybersecurity incidents, including reporting to regulators, which could subject us to
additional liability and reputational harm. See "Risk Factors" for more information on our cybersecurity risks and product vulnerability risks.

We aim to incorporate industry best practices throughout our cybersecurity program. Our cybersecurity strategy focuses on implementing effective and efficient controls,
technologies, and other processes to assess, identify, and manage material cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity program is designed to be aligned with applicable industry
standards and is assessed annually by independent third-party auditors. We have processes in place to assess, identify, manage, and address material cybersecurity threats and
incidents. These include, among other things: annual and ongoing security awareness training for employees; mechanisms to detect and monitor unusual network activity; and
containment and incident response tools. We actively engage with industry groups for benchmarking and awareness of best practices. We monitor issues that are internally
discovered or externally reported that may affect our products, and have processes to assess those issues for potential cybersecurity impact or risk. We also have a process in
place to manage cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service providers. We impose security requirements upon our suppliers, including: maintaining an effective
security management program; abiding by information handling and asset management requirements; and notifying us in the event of any known or suspected cyber incident.

Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk, which it manages as part of our enterprise risk management program. That program is utilized in making
decisions with respect to company priorities, resource allocations, and oversight structures. The Board of Directors is assisted by the Audit & Finance Committee, which regularly
reviews our cybersecurity program with management and reports to the Board of Directors. Cybersecurity reviews by the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors
generally occur at least twice annually, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. A number of Intel directors have experience in assessing and managing
cybersecurity risk.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information


Our cybersecurity program is run by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Our CISO is
informed about and monitors prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security
team, many of whom hold cybersecurity certifications such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager, and through the
use of technological tools and software and results from third party audits. Our CISO and CTO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and
cybersecurity risk. Our CISO has served in that position since 2015 and, before Intel, was previously the Chief Security Officer at McAfee and the Chief Information Officer and
CISO for the US House of Representatives. Our CTO joined Intel in 2021 and was previously Senior Vice President and CTO at VMware, with responsibility for product security.
Our CISO and CTO regularly report directly to the Audit & Finance Committee or the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and
remediate issues. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of Directors of material issues.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and most recently amended on October 24, 2019, to repurchase shares of our common
stock in open market or negotiated transactions. Our last share repurchase under this authorization occurred in Q1 2021, and no shares were repurchased during the fiscal year
ending December 30, 2023. As of December 30, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to$110.0 billion, of which$7.2 billion remained available.

We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our
employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These
withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.

Risk Factors and Other Key Information

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities,
transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are
conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party
subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local offices. All such
dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross
revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.

On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the
sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of
security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly
associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intel Corporation (the Company) as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Auditor's Reports

Description of the
Matter

Inventory Valuation

The Company's net inventory totaled$11.1 billion as of December 30, 2023, representing 5.8%of total
assets. As explained in "Note 2: Accounting Policies" within the consolidated financial statements, the
Company computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability
of products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order
to assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the
products have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the
determination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing
overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of
cost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of
saleable quality.

Auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the
determination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves and lower of cost or net realizable value is
judgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as
customer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand. Additionally, for certain
new product launches there is limited historical data with which to evaluate forecasts.

How We Addressed
the Matter in Our Audit

We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the
costing of inventory, the determination of whether inventory is of saleable quality, the determination of
demand forecasts and related application against on hand inventory, and the calculation of lower of cost or
net realizable value reserves including related estimated costs and selling prices.

Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions (e.g., estimated product
demand forecasts, costs and selling prices) of the underlying data used in management’s inventory valuation
assessment. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and
economic trends. We assessed whether there were any potential sources of contrary information, including
historical forecast accuracy or history of significant revisions to previously recorded inventory valuation
adjustments, and performed sensitivity analyses over significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in
inventory valuation that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Auditor's Reports

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intel Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Intel Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intel Corporation (the Company)
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial
statements of the Company and our report dated January 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1 :

Basis of Presentation

We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal years 2023 and 2021 were 52-week fiscal years; 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal
2024 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities
consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period
amounts to conform to current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.

Note 2 :

Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

We recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. Substantially all of
our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component, such as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product
and is substantially accounted for as a combined performance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone
product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-upon shipping terms.

We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as
an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of
consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their
receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other accrued liabilities.

We make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We generally record the payment as a
reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct service, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.

Inventories

We compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering
milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of
sales can be capitalized as inventory.

For a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This
milestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ
has previously valued inventory up to$870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost
of sales in the period incurred.

The valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and
assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our expectations of normal capacity level.
If the factory loading is below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it
would be recognized as cost of sales in that period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were$834 million in 2023,$423 million in
2022, and insignificant in 2021.

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances
reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling
price in relation to product cost. Lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time
due to scale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated pricing environment.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


 
The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use a demand forecast to develop
our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when
developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of
obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off
amounts considered to be excess inventory.

Long-Lived Assets

Property, Plant, and Equipment

We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures.
Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost.

At least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, considering factors such as the process
technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process
technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding
the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets
are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives. Effective January 2023, the estimated useful
lives of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate was applied prospectively beginning in the
first quarter of 2023.

Assets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review
include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or
planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is
considered to be impaired.

Identified Intangible Assets

We amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. Acquisition-related, in-process R&D assets represent the fair
value of incomplete R&D projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition; initially, these are classified as in-process R&D and are not subject to
amortization. Once these R&D projects are completed, the asset balances are transferred from in-process R&D to acquisition-related developed technology and are subject to
amortization from that point forward. The asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to R&D.

We perform periodic reviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our
business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether
events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized to reflect the
period in which they contribute to our cash flows.

Goodwill

Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We evaluate our reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments.
We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment
exist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and
liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.

Qualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. We may also
perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.

Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. Significant estimates include
market segment growth rates, our assumed market segment share, estimated gross margins, operating expenses, and discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted
average cost of capital. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change
from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of each reporting unit's fair value and potential
goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the
discount rate.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. In 2023, the fair value for all of our reporting units
exceeded their carrying value, and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary.

Government Incentives

Government incentives, including cash grants and refundable tax credits, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the incentive will be received and we will
comply with the conditions specified in the agreement or statutory requirements. We record capital-related incentives as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment, net within
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset. We record operating-related
incentives as a reduction to expense in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the expenditure for which the incentive is intended to compensate.

Fair Value

When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the
measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio
based on the underlying instrument type.

The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:

▪

▪

▪

Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.

Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations.
All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant
inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When
we use non-binding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed
pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.

Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs
and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level
3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.

Debt Investments

Debt investments include investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities of
approximately three months or less from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalents. Unhedged debt investments with original maturities at the date of
purchase greater than approximately three months and all economically hedged debt investments are classified as short-term investments, as they represent the investment of
cash available for current operations.

For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument, or the marketable debt investment itself is
used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments
arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative
instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net. Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost
basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these investments in interest and other, net.

Unhedged debt investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews. For investments in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists by considering
information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. We recognize an allowance
for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be
required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in interest and other, net,
and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Equity Investments

We regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity investments are measured and recorded as follows:

▪ Marketable equity securities are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value, whether

realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.

▪

▪

Non-marketable equity securities are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at
cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.
Equity method investments are equity securities in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Equity method
investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Our proportionate share of the income or
loss from equity method investments is recognized on a one-quarter lag.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net. The
carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted for qualifying observable price changes resulting from the issuance of similar or identical securities in an orderly
transaction by the same issuer. Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of
the securities.

Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews.
Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value
of our non-marketable equity investments using both the market and income approaches.

▪

▪

Non-marketable equity securities are tested for impairment using a qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property, plant, and equipment. Upon
determining that an impairment may exist, the security's fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the
carrying value exceeds the fair value.

Equity method investments are subject to periodic impairment reviews using the other-than-temporary impairment model, which considers the severity and duration of a
decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery.

Impairments of equity investments are recorded in gains (losses) on equity investments, net.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk,
commodity price risk, and credit risk. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. We also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain
derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. For presentation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we do not offset fair value amounts recognized
for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. Our derivative financial instruments, including related collateral amounts, are presented at fair value on a gross
basis and are included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities.

Cash flow hedges use foreign currency contracts, such as currency forwards and currency interest rate swaps, to hedge exposures for variability in the US-dollar equivalent of
non-US-dollar-denominated cash flows associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchases spending.

The after-tax gains or losses from the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of
the hedge transaction. For foreign currency contracts hedging our capital purchases, forward points are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment, and are recognized
in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the cash flow hedge transactions become improbable, the
corresponding amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be immediately reclassified to interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with
these derivatives are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.

Fair value hedges use interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge against changes in the fair value on certain of our fixed-rate indebtedness attributable to
changes in the benchmark interest rate. The gains or losses on these hedges, as well as the offsetting losses or gains related to the changes in the fair value of the underlying
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the current period, primarily in interest and other, net. Cash flows associated with these derivatives are
classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item, primarily within net cash provided by (used for) financing activities.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Non-designated hedges use foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities, and
non-US-dollar-denominated debt instruments classified as hedged investments. We also use interest rate contracts to hedge interest rate risk related to our US-dollardenominated fixed-rate debt investments classified as hedged investments. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded through earnings in the line item on the
Consolidated Statements of Income to which the derivatives most closely relate, primarily in interest and other, net. Changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and
liabilities associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the changes in the fair value of the related derivatives.

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments, derivative financial instruments, reverse
repurchase agreements, and trade and other receivables. We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit
exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments
in debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments.

We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master
netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations
exceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December 30, 2023, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US
treasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed$1.6 billion. To further reduce credit risk,
we enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligations, including
securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate. Cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other longterm assets, other accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record the collateral as an
asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.

A substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and
communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries. We believe the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers
(50%as of December 30, 2023) do not represent a significant credit risk, based on cash flow forecasts, balance sheet analysis, and past collection experience.

We have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk. We believe credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our
major customers. We assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis. From this analysis, we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will
seek to use one or more credit support protection devices, such as obtaining a parent guarantee, standby letter of credit, or credit insurance.

Variable Interest Entities

We have economic interests in entities that are VIEs. If we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial
statements. To determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our evaluation includes identification of
significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide services to the VIE. Periodically, we
assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.

Non-Controlling Interests

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of majority-owned subsidiaries consolidated under the variable interest and voting interest models. Non-controlling
interests represent the portion of equity not attributable to Intel and are reported as a separate component of equity, net of tax and transaction costs, on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for majority-owned subsidiaries are attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders on our
Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on respective ownership percentages. We account for changes in ownership
of our majority-owned subsidiaries as equity transactions when we retain a controlling financial interest.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Business Combinations

We allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition.
This allocation involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments in determining the fair value of the following:

▪

▪

▪

▪

inventory; property, plant, and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; and contingent consideration; each as may be applicable;

intangible assets, including the valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, discount rates, market segment growth rates, and our assumed market segment
share, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets;

deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; and

goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies.
These assumptions and estimates are used to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to
benefit from the business combination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the
assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and related goodwill.

Employee Equity Incentive Plans

We use the straight-line amortization method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the service period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. Upon exercise,
cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of stock options, or upon vesting or forfeiture of RSUs, we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and RSUs with multiple vesting dates for
each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each vesting period were a separate award.

For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay
in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is contingent upon continued employment. In addition,
the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.

Income Taxes

We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure
deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or
settled.

We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is affected by management's plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments;
therefore, such changes could also affect our future provision for taxes.

We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if (based on the technical merits of the position) it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on
examination by the tax authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for (benefit from) taxes on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in US taxable income as a period cost. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and
withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-US earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries, because we do not plan to indefinitely
reinvest such earnings and basis differences. Remittances of non-US earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working
capital and investment requirements of our non-US and US operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions
could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-US earnings, which could be subject to applicable non-US income and withholding taxes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Leases

Leases consist of real property and machinery and equipment. Our lease terms may include options to extend when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.
For leases for supplier capacity, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, we account for the lease and non-lease
components separately and do not include the non-lease components in our leased assets and corresponding liabilities. Payments on leases may be fixed or variable, and
variable lease payments are based on output of the underlying leased assets.

Loss Contingencies

We are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in
connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including
due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make
adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or
more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Note 3 :

Operating Segments

We previously announced the organizational change to integrate AXG into CCG and DCAI. This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to
accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other
business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors
our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.

We manage our business through the following operating segments:

▪
▪

▪

Client Computing Group
Data Center and AI

Network and Edge

▪ Mobileye
▪

Intel Foundry Services

We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a
stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.

CCG, DCAI, and NEX are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye and IFS do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the
results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.

We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.

We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪

results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives;

▪

▪
▪

▪

historical results of operations from divested businesses;

amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and

acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.

The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and
operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments.
Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating
segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products
are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating
income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments.
Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for
segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole.

In 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment. While Intel Optane is a leading technology, it was not
aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a result, we recognized an inventory impairment of$723 million in cost of sales on
the Consolidated Statements of Income in 2022. The impairment charge is recognized as a corporate charge in the "all other" category presented above.

financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties'
proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100%of the related
factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to
limit excess inventory held on site, or we will be subject to certain penalties.

We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona Fab of$29.0 billion.

As of December 30, 2023, a substantial majority of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The assets held by Arizona Fab, which can be used
only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were$4.8 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022).

Mobileye

In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of$1.0 billion. During the second quarter of 2023, we converted
38.5 million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5%of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for$42 per
share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of$1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by$663 million, net of tax. We continue to
consolidate the results of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements.

IMS Nanofabrication

In the third and fourth quarters of 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32%minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our IFS operating segment —
including a 20%stake to Bain Capital and a 10%stake to TSMC. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled$1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value
increased by$958 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.

We computed diluted earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to
the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.

During 2022, 70 million RSUs and stock options, as calculated on a weighted average basis for the year, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the
table above because they would have been anti-dilutive. These RSUs and options could potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in the future if the
average market value of the common shares increases above the exercise price. For all other periods presented, securities that would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant
and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.

credits. Capital-related incentives have terms of up to 15 years and operating-related incentives have terms that can vary widely. We are eligible to receive these incentives
because we engage in qualifying capital investments, R&D, and other activities as defined by the relevant government entities. This includes qualifying capital investments for
semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging manufacturing facilities construction and acquisition of equipment. Each incentive requires that we comply with certain conditions
for a period that may exceed the incentive terms. These conditions can include achievement of future operational targets and committing to minimum levels of capital investment.
If conditions are not satisfied, the incentives may be subject to reduction, recapture, or termination.

Capital-related incentives reduced gross property, plant, and equipment by$5.5 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022), of which$2.2 billion was
recognized in 2023 ($373 million in 2022). Capital-related incentives reduced depreciation expense by$226 million in 2023, of which substantially all reduced cost of sales
($230 million in 2022, all of which reduced cost of sales). Related incentives recognized during each period consisted of the following:

▪

▪

▪

US federal government pursuant to the US CHIPS and Science Act - We recognized a non-cash refundable advanced manufacturing investment tax credit of$845 million in
2023, which is recorded as an offset to income taxes payable. No incentives were recognized in 2022.

US state governments - We recognized$723 million of grants in 2023 related to two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. No incentives were recognized in 2022.

Non-US governments - We recognized$645 million of grants and refundable tax credits in 2023 ($373 million in 2022), a majority of which related to the expansion of silicon
wafer manufacturing facilities in Ireland.

Operating-related incentives benefited operating income by$202 million in 2023 ($104 million in 2022), a majority of which was recorded in cost of sales.

Capital-related and operating-related grants receivables totaled$559 million as of December 30, 2023 ($437 million as of December 31, 2022), a majority of which pertained to
capital-related grants and were recognized as non-cash investing activities. A substantial majority of the grants receivables were recorded within other long-term assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 30, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022. Capital-related refundable tax credits totaled$365 million as of December 30, 2023 (no
balance as of December 31, 2022) and were recorded within income taxes payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Litigation charges and other includes a$1.2 billion benefit in 2023 due to a reduction in the previously accrued$2.2 billion charge as a result of developments in the VLSI
litigation in the fourth quarter of 2023. 2023 charges also include a$401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine. In 2009, we recorded and paid an EC-imposed fine that was
subsequently annulled, resulting in a benefit of$1.2 billion in 2022. Refer to "Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information on legal proceedings related to the VLSI litigation and EC fine.

Also in 2023, we mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the agreement we entered into during 2022 to acquire Tower due to our inability to obtain required regulatory approvals
in a timely manner. We paid a termination fee in accordance with the terms of the agreement, resulting in a$353 million charge included in litigation charges and other.

8.5%Our effective tax rate decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by our R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not
dependent on lower income before taxes, and a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions.

Our effective tax rate decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions and a change in tax law
from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 2022.

We derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to non-US income taxed at different rates primarily from our operations in Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, and Malaysia. The
statutory tax rates in these jurisdictions range from 12.5%to 24.0%. We are subject to reduced tax rates in Israel and Malaysia as long as we conduct certain eligible activities
and make certain capital investments. We have conditional reduced tax rates that expire at various dates through 2056, and we expect to apply for renewals upon expiration. In
2023 the tax benefit specifically attributable to tax holidays was$129 million ($220 million for 2022 and$187 million for 2021) with a$0.03 impact on diluted earnings per share
($0.05 for 2022 and$0.05 for 2021).

Deferred tax assets are included within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The valuation allowance as of December 30, 2023 included allowances primarily related to unrealized state credit carryforwards of$2.6 billion.

As of December 30, 2023, our federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were$325 million and$1.7 billion, respectively. The majority of the
federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. The remaining federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through
2040. The federal and non-US net operating loss carryforwards include$141 million and$1.7 billion, respectively, that are not likely to be recovered and have been reduced by a
valuation allowance.

As of December 30, 2023, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately$19.9 billion that we have indefinitely invested, and on which we have
not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.

Current income taxes receivable of$59 million as of December 30, 2023 ($138 million as of December 31, 2022) are included in other current assets.

Long-term income taxes payable of$2.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022) are primarily composed of the transition tax from Tax Reform,
which is payable over eight years beginning in 2018, as well as amounts for uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated deduction for state taxes and non-US tax credits.

If the remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of$962 million as of December 30, 2023 ($914 million as
of December 31, 2022) and a reduction in the effective tax rate. Interest, penalties, and accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant in the periods
presented.

We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Although the timing of
the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that certain US federal and non-US tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months,
which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2023 could decrease
by as much as$314 million in the next 12 months.

We file federal, state, and non-US tax returns. We are no longer subject to US federal and non-US tax examinations for years prior to 2018 and 2015, respectively. For US state
tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to 2015.

Investments

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US
agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and
floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions
outside the US.

The fair value of our economically hedged marketable debt investments was$17.1 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($16.2 billion as of December 31, 2022). For hedged
investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net gains of$534 million in 2023 (net losses of$748 million in 2022 and net losses of$606 million in 2021). Net losses
on the related derivatives were$472 million in 2023 (net gains of$752 million in 2022 and net gains of$609 million in 2021).

Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was$4.7 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($10.2 billion as of December 31, 2022), which approximated the fair
value for these periods.

The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of December 30, 2023, was as follows:

NAND Memory Business

On December 29, 2021, we closed the first phase of our agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for$9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND
memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests as part of
the sale. The transaction will be completed in two closings and upon the first closing in the first quarter of 2022, SK hynix paid$7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized a
pre-tax gain of$1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of$495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the remaining proceeds we will
receive upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. The receivable outstanding was$2.0 billion as of December 30, 2023 and$1.9 billion December 31, 2022.

The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These
incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to$500 million annually, and$1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update
the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and
penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.

We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology,
finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. Reimbursed expenses approximated$145 million in 2022 and$125 million in 2023. We recorded a receivable due
from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of$145 million within other current assets as of December 30, 2023 ($133 million recorded as of December 31, 2022).

Senior Notes

In 2023, we issued a total of$11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes.

In 2022, we issued a total of$6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of$1.3 billion principal amount, and settled in
cash$1.6 billion of our senior notes that matured in May 2022,$1.0 billion of our senior notes that matured in July 2022, and$1.9 billion of our senior notes that matured in
December 2022. We also early cash settled$400 million of our senior notes due November 2023.

Our fixed-rate senior notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed-rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to
certain restrictions. The obligations under the notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and will effectively
rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Oregon and Arizona Bonds

In 2023, we remarketed$423 million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (the Arizona bonds)
and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission (the Oregon bonds). The bonds are unsecured general obligations in accordance with loan agreements we entered
into with each of the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA) and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. The bonds mature in
2035 and 2040 and have 3.8%and 4.1%coupons. Both the Arizona and Oregon bonds are subject to optional tender starting in February 2028 and mandatory tender in June
2028, at which time we may remarket the bonds for a new term period.

In 2022, we received proceeds of$600 million in the aggregate for the sale of bonds issued by CIDA. The bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with the
loan with the CIDA. The bonds mature in 2042 and 2052 and carry an interest rate of 5.0%. The bonds are subject to mandatory tender in September 2027, at which time we can
re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable-rate bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date. We
settled in cash$138 million of bonds issued by the Oregon Business Development Commission in March 2022.

Revolving Credit Facilities

In 2022, we entered into a$5.0 billion, 364-day variable-rate unsecured revolving credit facility that, if drawn, is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. In 2023, we
extended the maturity date from November 2023 to March 2024. In 2022, we amended our$5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement that we entered into in
2021, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning from LIBOR to term SOFR. In 2023, we extended the maturity date by one year to March 2028.

The revolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets—such as intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment—are recorded
at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized on our nonmarketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3.

We classify non-marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity method investments as Level 3. Impairments recognized on these investments held as of December 30,
2023 were$202 million ($179 million on investments held as of December 31, 2022).

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Financial assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been
remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, long-term receivables, and issued debt.

We classify the fair value of grants receivable, long-term receivables, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as Level 2. The
estimated fair value of these financial assets approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 30, 2023 was$559 million (the
aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of December 31, 2022 was$437 million). The aggregate carrying value of reverse repurchase agreements with original
maturities greater than three months as of December 30, 2023 was$0 (the aggregate carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was$400 million).

We classify the fair value of issued debt (excluding commercial paper) as Level 2. The fair value of these instruments was$47.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 ($34.3 billion as
of December 31, 2022).

Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Contribution Plans

We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans for the benefit of eligible employees, former employees, and retirees in the US and certain other countries. The plans are
designed to provide employees with an accumulation of funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For the benefit of eligible US employees, we also provide an unfunded nontax-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees.

We expensed$272 million in 2023,$489 million in 2022, and$444 million in 2021 for matching contributions based on the amount of employee contributions under the US
qualified defined contribution and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The matching contribution in the US qualified defined contribution plan was reduced from March 1
through December 31, 2023.

US Retiree Medical Plan

Upon retirement, we provide certain benefits to eligible US employees who were hired prior to 2014 under the US Retiree Medical Plan. The benefits can be used to pay all or a
portion of the cost to purchase eligible coverage in a medical plan.

As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation was$490 million and$527 million, which used the discount rates of 5.3%and 5.6%. The
December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 corresponding fair value of plan assets was$548 million and$501 million. As of December 30, 2023, the US Retiree Medical Plan
was in the net asset position.

The investment strategy for US Retiree Medical Plan assets is to invest primarily in liquid assets, due to the level of expected future benefit payments. The assets are invested in
tax-aware global equity and fixed-income long credit portfolios. Both portfolios are actively managed by external managers. The tax-aware global equity portfolio is composed of
a diversified mix of equities in developed countries. The tax-aware fixed-income long credit portfolio is composed of domestic securities. The allocation to each asset class will
fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 45%equity and 55%fixedincome investments. As of December 30, 2023, the majority of the US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in exchange-traded equity securities and were measured at fair
value using Level 1 inputs. The remaining US Retiree Medical Plan assets were invested in fixed-income investments and were measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs.

As of December 30, 2023, the estimated benefit payments for this plan over the next 10 years are as follows:

(In Millions)
Postretirement medical benefits$34$35$35$35$36$2029-2033

Pension Benefit Plans

We provide defined-benefit pension plans in certain countries, most significantly Ireland, the US, Germany and Israel. The majority of the plans' benefits have been frozen.

Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit Plans

The vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension plan is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the
employee's expected date of separation or retirement.

The projected benefit obligation was approximately 30%in the US and 70%outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
The fair value of plan assets was approximately 40%in the US and 60%outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
The accumulated other comprehensive loss (income), before tax, was approximately 70%in the US and 30%outside of the US as of December 30, 2023 (approximately 90%in the US and
10%outside of the US as of December 31, 2022).

Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are generally driven by discount rate movement. We use the corridor approach to amortize actuarial
gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10%of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis.

As of December 30, 2023, the accumulated benefit obligations were$0.8 billion and$1.9 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 30, 2023, the
US plan was in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of
December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations were$0.9 billion and$1.6 billion for the US plan and non-US plans, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the US and
Ireland plans were in the net asset position and the other non-US plans had projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the US, Ireland, and
Israel plans had assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations, whereas the remaining non-US plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the
target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.

Funding

Our practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of applicable local laws and regulations. Funding for the US Retiree
Medical Plan is discretionary under applicable laws and regulations. Additional funding may be provided for the pension and retiree medical plans as deemed appropriate.

On a worldwide basis, our pension and retiree medical plans were 83%funded as of December 30, 2023. The US Pension Plan, which accounts for 26%of the worldwide
pension and retiree medical benefit obligations, was 107%funded. Funded status is not indicative of our ability to pay ongoing pension benefits or of our obligation to fund
retirement trusts. Required pension funding for US retirement plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, which sets required minimum contributions. Cumulative company
funding to the US Pension Plan currently exceeds the minimum ERISA funding requirements.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost

The net periodic benefit cost for pension and US retiree medical benefits was$107 million in 2023 ($139 million in 2022 and$162 million in 2021).

The investment strategy for US Pension Plan assets is to manage the funded status volatility, taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility to help
enable sufficient assets to be available to pay pension benefits as they come due. The allocation to each asset class will fluctuate with market conditions, such as volatility and
liquidity concerns, and will typically be rebalanced when outside the target ranges, which are 91%fixed income and 9%equity investments. During 2023, the US Pension Plan
assets were invested in collective investment trust funds, which are measured at net asset value.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Non-US Plan Assets

The investments of the non-US plans are managed by insurance companies, pension funds, or third-party trustees, consistent with regulations or market practice of the country
where the assets are invested. The investment manager makes investment decisions within the guidelines set by Intel or local regulations. Investments managed by qualified
insurance companies or pension funds under standard contracts follow local regulations, and we are not actively involved in their investment strategies. For the assets that we
have the discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or
direct investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market
risk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified
mix of equities of developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the
assets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds, and equity index funds. The target allocation of the non-US plan assets that we have
control over was approximately 40%fixed income, 40%equity, and 20%hedge fund investments in 2023.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit Plans

Employee Equity Incentive Plans

Our equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. Our plans
include our 2006 Plan and our 2006 ESPP.

Under the 2006 Plan, 1.1 billion shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors through June 2026. As
of December 30, 2023, 194 million shares of common stock remained available for future grants.

Under the 2006 Plan, we may grant RSUs and stock options. We grant RSUs with a service condition as well as RSUs with a market condition, performance condition, and a
service condition, which we call PSUs. PSUs are granted to a group of senior officers and employees. For PSUs granted in 2023 and 2022, the number of shares of our common
stock to be received at vesting at the end of the three-year performance period will range from 0%to 200%of the target grant amount. The PSU payout will be determined based
on our performance (i) relative to annual targets for each year in the performance period with respect to a revenue growth metric, weighted 60%, and a cash flow from operations
metric, weighted 40%, which results are then averaged at the end of the three-year performance period; and (ii) as may be adjusted by two equally weighted modifiers: the TSR
of our common stock measured against the benchmark TSR of above median of the S&P 500 Index over a three-year period and revenue CAGR for the three-year performance
period. TSR is a measure of stock price appreciation plus any dividends paid in this performance period. For 2023 PSUs, overall payout will be capped at target grant amount if
our absolute TSR is negative. As of December 30, 2023, 16 million PSUs were outstanding. PSUs vest three years and one month following the start of the performance period.
Other RSU awards and option awards generally vest over four years from the grant date.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation recognized in 2023 was$3.2 billion ($3.1 billion in 2022 and$2.0 billion in 2021). During 2023, the tax benefit that we realized for the tax deduction
from share-based awards totaled$571 million ($478 million in 2022 and$377 million in 2021).

We estimate the fair value of RSUs and PSUs with a service condition or performance condition using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the
present value of dividends expected to be paid on our shares of common stock prior to vesting. We estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition using a Monte Carlo
simulation model as of the date of grant using historical volatility.

The aggregate fair value of awards that vested in 2023 was$2.2 billion ($2.0 billion in 2022 and$1.7 billion in 2021), which represents the market value of our common stock on
the date that the RSUs vested. The grant-date fair value of awards that vested in 2023 was$2.7 billion ($2.5 billion in 2022 and$1.4 billion in 2021). The number of RSUs vested
includes shares of common stock that we withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. RSUs that are expected to vest are net
of estimated future forfeitures.

As of December 30, 2023, unrecognized compensation costs related to RSUs granted under our equity incentive plans were$4.0 billion. We expect to recognize those costs
over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

Stock Purchase Plan

The 2006 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85%of the value of our common stock on specific dates. Under the 2006 ESPP, 523
million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance through August 2026. As of December 30, 2023, 157 million shares of common stock remained available for
issuance.

Employees purchased 43 million shares of common stock in 2023 for$1.0 billion under the 2006 ESPP (27 million shares of common stock for$931 million in 2022 and 22
million shares of common stock for$925 million in 2021). As of December 30, 2023, unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of
common stock under the 2006 ESPP totaled$57 million. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately two months.

Leases

We recognized operating leased assets in other long-term assets of$505 million and corresponding accrued liabilities of$142 million, and other long-term liabilities of$289
million as of December 30, 2023. Our operating leases have remaining terms of 1 to 13 years and may include options to extend the leases for up to 38 years. The weighted
average remaining lease term was 6.0 years, and the weighted average discount rate was 5.0%as of December 30, 2023, for our operating leases.

Operating lease expense was$407 million in 2023 ($729 million in 2022 and$798 million in 2021), including$213 million in variable lease expense in 2023 ($551 million in 2022
and$620 million in 2021).

In 2022 and 2021, we signed finance leases for supplier capacity. The leases will commence upon start of supplier production and will have a weighted average remaining lease

Legal Proceedings

We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. As of December 30, 2023, we have accrued a charge of$1.0 billion related to litigation involving VLSI and a charge of$401 million related to an EC-imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below,
management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings,
excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters
include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable
resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or
requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might
also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial
payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.

European Commission Competition Matter

In 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered
Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments”
that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC
ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in
its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In
January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in
February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.

In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us
based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.

In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the
original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.

Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities

In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as
“Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with
other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the
security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.

As of January 24, 2024, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of
purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of
security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US,
class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor
of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs appealed, and in November 2023 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s
judgment. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario,
and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action
complaint relating to Spectre and Meltdown in June 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. In
November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant
disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” We moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2024. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking
monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that
alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified,
and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise
from these matters.

Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement

Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020
announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated
complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they
generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court
granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. Given the procedural posture and the nature
of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the
ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or
range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4.

Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims

We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and
technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders
preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing
products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to
indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages,
accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may
discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.

VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel

In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and
processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI granted Intel a covenant not to sue on the two patents the court said can
proceed to trial as it appeals losses it suffered earlier in the case on three other patents. VLSI has requested that the judge take the trial scheduled for March 2024 off calendar.
In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight
additional patents it had acquired from NXP:

▪

▪

▪

The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI$1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and$675 million for infringement of
another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI$2.1 billion in damages and approximately$162.3
million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court’s rejection of Intel’s claim to
have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal
Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded$675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the
patent for which VLSI had been awarded$1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and will send the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on
that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the PTAB
instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed
the PTAB’s decision.

The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately$3.0 billion for alleged
infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment.

The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI
approximately$949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new
trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible.

In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu)
Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property
Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as
well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court
dismissed VLSI’s case.

In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.
asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an
injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision
finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement.

As a result of recent developments in the VLSI litigation, we revised our loss exposure estimate and reduced our previously accrued charge of$2.2 billion to approximately$1.0
billion. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts
given recent developments and future proceedings.

R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation

In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in
the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger
Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. R2 seeks an injunction in
both actions prohibiting the sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. Intel is indemnifying its customers in the German lawsuit.

Intel disputes R2’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In December 2022, Intel responded in the UK action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that the
patent is invalid. In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a
disproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid.

Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


 
In December 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion finding R2’s patent valid. The German Federal Patent Court’s final decision on invalidity is
expected in October 2024. In December 2023, the court in Dusseldorf held a trial on the issue of infringement, and will hand down a decision in February 2024. If defendants lose
at trial in Germany, the Dusseldorf Regional Court could impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of some or all of the accused products, and potentially other
products, in Germany. The order could take effect and remain in place unless overturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court.

Trial in the UK matter is scheduled for April 2024. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there are significant factual and legal issues to be
resolved and that uncertainty exists as to the scope of an injunction, if any, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might
arise from these lawsuits.

Business Interruption Insurance Proceeds

We received$484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and property damage from a temporary electrical
breakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020. We recognized these receipts as a reduction of cost of sales.

Controls and Procedures

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on management's evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter
ended December 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes
in accordance with US GAAP.

Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included evaluation of
elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP.
We reviewed the results of management's assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, as
stated in the firm's attestation report, which is included within Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.

Congratulations! On behalf of Intel Corporation (“Intel” or the “Company”), I am pleased to offer you the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer,
reporting to me. The role will be based in Santa Clara, California.

Base Salary. Your starting annual base salary will be$800,000 less applicable taxes, deductions, and withholdings.

Annual Performance Bonus (APB): You will be eligible for an Annual Performance Bonus (“APB”). Your APB Payout Goal is$1,320,000. Payouts under the APB are subject to
eligibility and other program conditions, as well as the company’s performance to its financial and operational goals. Payouts are not guaranteed and will be prorated based on
your start date.

Quarterly Profit Bonus. You are eligible for quarterly bonuses under the Quarterly Profit Bonus (“QPB”) program. These bonuses are determined based on Intel’s quarterly
profitability, subject to the terms of the QPB plan. QPBs are paid out in the month following the close of each calendar quarter. Based on historical payouts, we anticipate this will
pay you approximately$18,600 per quarter ($74,400 annually). Your first quarterly bonus will be prorated to reflect the actual dates of participation for any portion of the quarter
that you are employed with Intel. Subject to local law, to earn and receive a QPB, you must be employed on the Intel payroll before the cutoff date for each three-month bonus
period and have received eligible earnings before the cutoff date.

Target Cash Compensation. Your target annual cash compensation is$2,194,400; this is composed of your base salary, target APB payout, and estimated QPB payout. Your
base salary and APB Payout Goal will be reviewed annually as part of our performance review process.

Annual Equity Grant. As an employee of Intel, we would like you to share in the success of Intel Corporation through the Company's stock benefit program. Therefore, the
target value for your 2022 long-term incentive equity award will be approximately$9,300,000, which will be comprised of approximately 50%Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”)
and 50%Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”). The exact number of PSUs and RSUs will be determined on the grant date, based on the average daily (on days where trading
occurred) market value of Intel stock over 30 calendar days leading up to and including that date. The RSUs will vest over a three-year period: 1/12 of the RSUs vesting per
quarter beginning on the three-month anniversary of the grant date and continuing for three years such that the grant is fully vested on the three-year anniversary of grant date.
The PSUs and RSUs will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, the Notice of Grant for each award, and grant agreement
linked to your Notice of Grant.

New Hire Cash Bonus. For your make-whole compensation, you will receive a sign on bonus (“New Hire Cash Bonus”) of$20,000,000, less applicable taxes, deductions, and
withholdings, which will be payable to you in two installments:$5,000,000 will be payable within 30 days following your start date and the remaining$15,000,000 will be payable
within 30 days following July 1, 2022. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that you voluntarily resign your employment for any reason or Intel terminates your employment
for Cause (as defined below), in each case, within two (2) years following the applicable payment date for the applicable installment bonus, you will repay, on the date of your
employment termination, the portion of each installment bonus paid to you on a pro-rated basis based on the number of days remaining in such two-year period for each
installment as of the date your employment terminates, by writing a check to Intel for such amount or otherwise entering into a repayment arrangement satisfactory to Intel. In
addition, subject to applicable law, Intel may recover the cash payment that is required to be


repaid by (1) reducing the amount that would otherwise be payable to you under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by Intel, (2) reducing any
severance benefits that would otherwise be payable or provided to you under any plan, program, or arrangement maintained or entered into by Intel (including under any
employment or severance agreement), or (3) by any combination of the foregoing.

For purposes of this letter, “Cause” means (1) commission of an act of material fraud or dishonesty against Intel; (2) intentional refusal or willful failure to carry out the reasonable
and lawful instructions of the Chief Executive Officer, Intel’s Board of Directors, or any of their designee(s) (other than any such failure resulting from your disability); (3)
conviction of, guilty plea, or “no contest” plea to a felony or to a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (4) gross misconduct in connection with the performance of your duties;
(5) improper disclosure of confidential information or material violation of Intel’s Code of Conduct or other Intel policy or employment guidelines; (6) breach or any
misrepresentation under, any intellectual property, invention assignment, confidentiality, or proprietary information agreement to which Intel is a party; (7) failure to reasonably
cooperate with Intel in any investigation or formal proceeding or being found liable in a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action or otherwise being disqualified
from serving in your position with Intel; or (8) breach of duty of loyalty to Intel. Prior to termination for Cause, Intel shall provide 30 days prior written notice to you of the grounds
for Cause and give you an opportunity within those 30 days to cure the alleged breach. The parties recognize that given the egregious nature of the conduct defined as Cause, a
cure may not be possible. No act or failure to act on your part shall be considered “willful” unless it was done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith and without reasonable belief
that your act or omission was in the best interests of Intel. Any act, or failure to act, based upon express authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by Intel’s Board of
Directors or the direction of Intel’s Chief Executive Officer with respect to such act or omission, or based upon the advice of legal counsel for Intel, shall be conclusively
presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of Intel and, in any event, will not be considered an event which may give rise to
Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Intel expressly agree that Intel does not expect, and will not require, you to engage in any activities that would violate your
existing obligations to any prior employer, including to maintain the confidentiality of such employer’s proprietary business information. If you refuse or fail to carry out any
instruction by the Chief Executive Officer or Intel’s Board of Directors because of such existing obligations, your refusal or failure will not constitute Cause for termination.

Other Employment Terms. In the event your employment is terminated by Intel without Cause and you sign and do not revoke a release in favor of Intel and its affiliates,
substantially in the form of Intel’s Confidential Separation Agreement and General Release of Claims, Intel will pay you any unpaid portion of the New Hire Cash Bonus on the
thirtieth day following your termination of employment.
Comprehensive Benefits. Intel provides a very competitive benefits package for its eligible employees. You will be eligible for our medical, dental, vision, short-term and longterm disability, and life insurance programs. In addition, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 401(k) Plan, and deferred compensation plan.

You will be eligible for about 4 weeks of vacation and 10 company holidays each year, as well as our fully-paid sabbaticals. Each of these benefits is subject to the terms and
conditions of the benefit program and plans, including waiting periods for some. Learn more about these and other outstanding benefits at
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/jobs/benefits.html.

Relocation Assistance. To assist you and your family with relocation to the Bay Area, we will provide you with a customized relocation package. Packages are based on your
individual needs and Intel relocation guidelines. A Relocation Consultant will reach out to you soon to discuss the best package options for you.

Outside Activities During Employment. During your employment, you shall devote your full business efforts and time to Intel. This obligation, however, shall not preclude you
from engaging in appropriate civic, charitable or religious activities, as long as they do not materially interfere with your job. Any outside activities, including serving on a Board of
Directors, must be in compliance with Intel’s Code of Conduct and subject to applicable approvals and policies.

Company Policies/Protection of Intellectual Property. Your employment is contingent on your signing an Employment Agreement, which outlines your obligations as an
employee, including among others your obligation to protect Intel’s intellectual property (as well as confidential information of your prior employers and other third parties). You
will be expected to abide by the Company’s policies and procedures, including without limitation Intel’s Employment Guidelines and Code of Conduct.

At-Will Employment. Your employment with Intel is “at will,” which means that both Intel and you have the right to end your employment at any time, with or without advance
notice, and with or without cause. The at-will nature of your employment may not be modified or amended except by written agreement signed by Intel’s Chief People officer and
you.


Position of Trust Background Check/Work Eligibility. Because of the importance of your position, this offer is contingent upon the successful completion of a Position of Trust
background check and successful reference check. You represent that all information provided to Intel or its agents with regard to your background is true and correct. As a
further condition of employment, you are required by law to provide appropriate documentation of your legal right to work in the United States.

Vaccine Requirement and Proof. Intel strongly encourages employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Intel aligns to federal, state, and local laws and, as a contractor to
the U.S. Government, is subject to government mandates that may be issued. By accepting this offer, you acknowledge that you understand and agree that Intel’s policies for
COVID-19 including guidance about testing and vaccination are subject to change over time and that adherence to these policies is a term and condition of your employment at
Intel.

Counterparts. This offer letter may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.
Entire Agreement. This offer letter including the referenced documents forms the entire agreement between you and Intel and replaces all prior communications on matters
related to employment at Intel.

INTEL CORPORATION

COMPENSATION RECOUPMENT POLICY

(Effective as of October 2, 2023)

Exhibit 97.1

1. PURPOSE

The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Intel Corporation (the “Corporation”) has established this policy
(this “Policy”) that provides for recoupment of certain Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below) paid to a Covered Executive (as defined below) in the
event the Corporation is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement (as defined below). Each Covered Executive shall be required to sign and return to the
Corporation the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such Covered Executive will agree to be bound by, and to comply with,
the terms and conditions of this Policy.

2. ADMINISTRATION

This Policy is administered by the Committee and is intended to comply with, and as applicable to be administered and interpreted consistent with, and
subject to the exceptions set forth in, Listing Standard 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (collectively, “Rule 10D-1”). The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,
appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Committee under this Policy shall be final and binding on all
affected individuals.

3. EFFECTIVE DATE

This Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).

4. DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Policy:

a.

“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance by the Corporation with any financial reporting
requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial
statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were
corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.

b.

“Covered Executive” means an individual who is an “executive officer” of the Corporation as defined under Rule 10D-1.

c.

“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation
Received by a person: (i) on or after the Effective Date and after the person began service as a Covered Executive; (ii) who served as a
Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation; (iii) while the Corporation has a class of
securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association; and (iv) during the Recovery Period, that exceeds the
amount that would have been Received if determined or calculated based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.


d.

e.

f.

g.

“Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in
preparing the Corporation’s financial statements and any measure derived wholly or in part from such a measure, and (ii) any measure based
in whole or in part on the Corporation’s stock price or total shareholder return. For the avoidance of doubt, a Financial Reporting Measure need
not be presented within the Corporation’s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation granted, earned, or vested based in whole or in part on the Corporation’s
attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.

Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed to be “Received” in the fiscal period during which the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is
attained, regardless of when the compensation is actually paid or awarded. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is
subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered Received when the
relevant Financial Reporting Measure is achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based
vesting condition.

“Recovery Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Corporation is required to prepare the
Accounting Restatement described in this Policy, including any applicable transition period that results from a change in the Corporation’s fiscal
year within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. The “date that the Corporation is required to prepare the Accounting
Restatement” is the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Audit Committee of the Board or the Board, or the officer(s) of the Corporation authorized
to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Corporation is required to prepare
an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Corporation to prepare an Accounting
Restatement, in each case regardless of if or when the restated financial statements are filed.

5. RECOVERY OF INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION

a.

It is the Corporation’s policy that in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Corporation will recover on a reasonably prompt basis the
amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation.

b. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation
is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the Committee will determine the
amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the relevant
stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received, and the Corporation shall maintain
documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Market.

6. METHOD OF RECOVERY

a. The Corporation may effect any recovery from the Covered Executives pursuant to this Policy by requiring payment of such amount(s) to the

Corporation, by set-off, by reducing future compensation, or by such other means or combination of means as the Committee determines to be
appropriate and in accordance with applicable law.

b. The Corporation need not recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation if and to the extent that the Committee determines that such

recovery is impracticable, subject to and in accordance with applicable exceptions under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules,


and not required under Rule 10D-1, including if the Committee, after making a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts, determines that
the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered.

7. NON-EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

Any right of recoupment or recovery pursuant to this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be

available to the Corporation pursuant to the terms of any other policy, any agreement or plan or award terms, and any other legal remedies available to the
Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not recoup amounts pursuant to such other policy, terms, or remedies to the extent it is recovered pursuant to
this Policy.

8.

INDEMNIFICATION PROHIBITION

The Corporation shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or

reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential recovery obligations under this Policy, or any
advancement of expenses (including attorneys’ fees).

9. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION

The Committee may amend, modify, supplement, rescind, or replace all or any portion of this Policy at any time and from time to time in its discretion,

and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which
the Corporation’s securities are listed.

10. SUCCESSORS

This Policy is binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal

representatives.
